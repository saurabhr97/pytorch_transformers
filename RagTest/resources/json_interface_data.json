The duo were set to produce the film alongside James Weaver through their company Point Grey Pictures, while Invincible co-creator Robert Kirkman also joined to produce alongside David Alpert, Bryan Furst, and Sean Furst through his company Skybound Entertainment, which had a first-look deal with Universal for the film. However, when the series was announced, the film remained in hiatus, until on January 26, 2021, it was revealed that the film was still in development and would exist separately from the series. In a 2023 interview, Rogen stated that the animated series has had a strong influence on the live-action film version in development with Universal, which is essentially being developed as a live-action version of the animated series.\nOn August 11, 2017, Robert Kirkman signed a deal with Amazon to develop various series for Amazon Prime Video, with his company Skybound Entertainment. However, it was revealed that series that are already in production or development with other studios, will not be developed for Amazon. Kirkman revealed that he was interested on developing a series of the Invincible comic series, but that would not be possible at the moment because Universal was developing a film based on the comic series.\nHowever, on June 19, 2018, it was announced that Amazon had given a series order to the project for a first season consisting of eight episodes. It was also revealed that the series would be animated and its episodes would be hourlong. Simon Racioppa serves as showrunner for the series and also serves as executive producer alongside Kirkman, David Alpert, and Catherine Winder. Production companies involved with the series include Skybound. Coincidentally, executive producers Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen (who also provides a voice on the show) are working on a live-action film adaptation of the comic, which is separate from the animated series, as co-directors", ", writers, and producers.\nOn April 29, 2021, after the release of the final episode of the first season, Amazon renewed the series for a second and third season. In April 2023, series creator Robert Kirkman stated that the second season would focus on Angstrom Levy, a supervillain with access to multiple dimensions. In April 2024, Amazon was reported to have renewed the series for a fourth and fifth season, although IGN subsequently reported this was not accurate. In May 2024, Ross Marquand said that season 3 \"is nearly finished\" and is to be released in early 2025. In July 2024, Amazon officially renewed the series for a fourth season.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nOn January 31, 2019, the cast of the series was revealed, with Steven Yeun to portray Mark Grayson / Invincible and J. K. Simmons portraying Nolan Grayson / Omni-Man. Sandra Oh, Mark Hamill, Seth Rogen, Gillian Jacobs, Andrew Rannells, Zazie Beetz, Walton Goggins, Jason Mantzoukas, Mae Whitman, Chris Diamantopoulos, Malese Jow, Kevin Michael Richardson, Grey Griffin and Max Burkholder also joined the cast of the series. On July 18, 2020, Robert Kirkman confirmed the casting in a live video on Twitter.\nYeun and Oh are both of Korean descent. Oh's character Debbie Grayson was made to be Korean American in the animated adaptation, with her son Mark Grayson being half-Korean. Their Korean identity is not directly mentioned in the show, but a painting featuring Hangul (\uc548\ub155, annyeong, 'hello') is depicted in the Grayson home. The decision came from a desire to increase diverse representations in the show. Similarly, Amber Bennett, Mark's girlfriend, was made an African American teenager in the adaptation. The character of William, Mark's best friend, is openly gay from the outset of the series in contrast to the comics, where he spends a significant amount of time closeted.\n\n\n=== Animation and title sequence ===\nWhen the show was confirmed to be animated, it was confirmed that Wind Sun Sky Entertainment and its partner com", "pany, Skybound North, would be co-producing and animating the series.\nRobert Kirkman praised the work of the show's animation studio, Maven Image Project. Kirkman noted in particular the Guardians' death at the end of episode 1, and the fight between Mark and Nolan in episode 8. Two additional animation studios were brought on for season 2 according to an interview with Margaret Dean.\nThe series title sequence is recognized by appearing right where a character would have said \"Invincible\" for the first time at each episode. However, the title sequence also becomes bloodier with each episode. Invincible's creator Robert Kirkman revealed that he wanted to represent the dark days that lie ahead by using the increasingly bloody title cards. Simon Racioppa revealed that he wanted each episode to be different from the previous ones to convince the audience to not skip it. The animation style borrows from the look of Saturday morning cartoons from the early 2000s.\nThe second season's title cards feature a similar progression, with a bloodied variant of the first season's title card cracking to uncover a black-and-blue design underneath.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nOn December 2, 2020, it was revealed that John Paesano would be composing the score to the series.\n\n\n== Release ==\nAfter Amazon ordered the first season of the series, it was confirmed that the series would be consisting of eight episodes. On January 22, 2021, during a live-stream celebrating the 18th anniversary of Invincible #1, Kirkman revealed that the series would debut on March 25, 2021 (midnight EST), with the first 3 episodes. The remaining episodes would release weekly thereafter. On January 20, 2023, a teaser trailer was released, in which Steven Yeun and Seth Rogen as Invincible and Allen the Alien respectively discuss the upcoming season. During San Diego Comic-Con on July 21, 2023, a second trailer was shown, and it was announced that part one of the second season will premiere on November 3, 2023, with part two", " debuting on March 14, 2024. It was also announced that a special episode, called Invincible: Atom Eve, would release later that day.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\n\nThe series received critical acclaim, with praise for its animation, performances, and writing. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season of Invincible holds a 98% approval rating, based on 88 critic reviews, with an average rating of 8.6/10. The site's consensus reads: \"With bold animation, bloody action, and an all-star cast led by the charming Steven Yeun, Invincible smartly adapts its source material without sacrificing its nuanced perspective on the price of superpowers.\" Metacritic reported a score of 73 out of 100 based on 16 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\" for the first season. The second season has an approval rating of 100% based on 41 reviews, , with an average rating of 8.4/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Still as bracing as a punch to the face and invigorating with its vivid worldbuilding, Invincible is practically impervious to disappointing audiences in this sterling sophomore season.\" On Metacritic, the season has a weighted average score of 82 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nBen Travers of IndieWire gave the show a B grade, stating that \"Kirkman's adaptation is provocative, surprising, and sometimes challenging, as it constantly tries to disrupt the accepted ideas of its genre, whether that's the superhero genre, the teen drama genre, or the misguided notion that animation is a genre unto itself.\" Kathryn VanArendonk of Vulture states \"the series has a palpable 'more of an eight-hour movie' thing going on, and the potential of that model is that it will all coalesce in the end into this glorious, big, transfixing story\" but also adds that \"the pitfall is that it makes these opening episodes a little weaker; there are so many characters happening here, so many story threads to put in place, that i", "t's hard to know what to invest in as a viewer.\" Caroline Framke from Variety commented: \"Now, of course, Kirkman is the wildly successful co-creator and executive producer of 'The Walking Dead,' so even those who might not have picked up an 'Invincible' comic might be interested in this spry, hourlong animated series that somehow manages to be both snarky and earnest within the same breath.\" William Hughes from The A.V. Club praised the series for its animation and stated: \"Funny, exciting, and emotionally smart\u2014seriously, Sandra Oh is killing it here\u2014Invincible isn't bulletproof. But, like its increasingly burdened hero, it's trying. And sometimes, in the superhero game, that's all you can really do.\" Bob Strauss from Datebook praised the show, commenting: \"While you can't describe 'Invincible' as gritty, it does feel like the right kind of animated super-show for an era marked by Zack Snyder's dark-hued 'Justice League' reconstruction and Amazon's own, ultra-pathological take on the genre, 'The Boys.' It's as clean-looking as any program we grew up with, but it has the dirtier stuff we secretly wanted.\"\nSiddhant Adlakha of IGN gave the first season an 8 out of 10, stating the season \"is great, thanks to its unique action and strong character-centric gravitas\" and that the show \"combines familiar superhero tropes with unexpected gore and moving character dynamics, resulting in the year's most surprising superhero series.\" Alan Sepinwall from Rolling Stone stated: \"As the series moves along, Kirkman and company begin introducing twists to what we think is the formula \u2014 perhaps too many. Even within three episodes, the number of reversals and secrets pile so high that it can be hard to invest in certain characters and scenes, rather than trying to guess what will come next.\" Roxana Hadadi from RogerEbert.com praised the series for its story and animation, commenting: \"'Invincible' sets up those questions quickly and engagingly in these first three installments, wrap", "s them in a mystery, and then splatters them with blood. It's not an entirely new approach for this genre, but the familiarity of 'Invincible' is forgivable in light of the confidence that both Kirkman and Yeun bring to the material. They're the reason to watch.\" Niv M. Sultan from Slant Magazine gave the first season 3.5 stars of 4, and commented \"Invincible recaptures what our current glut of superhero fiction largely loses sight of: the pleasure that superheroes must feel when wielding their powers. Not the sacred satisfaction of helping the downtrodden, but the id-centered thrills of soaring through the sky and inflicting hurt on those deemed deserving.\" Louis Chilton from The Independent gave the series 3 stars of 5 and stated \"Invincible often seems derivative; perhaps its ideas were more groundbreaking in the original early-2000s comics. Some of its characters are unapologetic parodies (the Batman facsimile \"Darkwing\", for example), and you could easily go through picking out elements or story ideas that have cropped up in Watchmen, or The Incredibles, or Sky High, or Misfits. But there are still some good bones to its premise, and just enough subversiveness to let you ignore the fact this is a story you've seen a hundred times before.\"\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\n\n=== In other media ===\nThe eighth episode of the series' first season spawned a popular Internet meme called \"Think, Mark\". A 2022 promotional episode of the web series Death Battle! pit Invincible's Omni-Man against The Boys' Homelander, with Amazon Studios' Head of Marketing Adam Bersin having partnered with Rooster Teeth to promote their series, previously including the second season of The Boys, also produced by Amazon. Consequently, both Omni-Man and Homelander were made available as playable characters in the 2023 video game Mortal Kombat 1, with J. K. Simmons reprising his role as the former. In November 2023, the RPG Invincible Presents: Atom Eve was released. In February 2024, a mobile game RPG c", "alled Invincible: Guarding the Globe was released. In April 2024, Skybound was revealed to be internally developing an AAA video game based on Invincible. Over 30 employees were working on the game, which included industry veterans who had worked for Electronic Arts, Activision Blizzard, and AMZ Games, while a fundraiser campaign was also being established.\n\n\n=== Lawsuit ===\nInvincible creator Robert Kirkman was sued by comic book colorist William Crabtree, citing a rights and profits concern, on January 10, 2022. The case was settled on January 25, 2024.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website  on Amazon Prime Video\nOfficial website at Skybound.com\nInvincible at IMDb \nInvincible on X\nInvincible on Instagram\nInvincible at Comic Vine", "The Invincible (Polish: Niezwyci\u0119\u017cony) is a hard science fiction novel by Polish writer Stanis\u0142aw Lem, serialized in Gazeta Bialostocka in 1963 and published as a book in 1964.\nThe Invincible originally appeared as the title story in Lem's collection Niezwyci\u0119\u017cony i inne opowiadania (\"The Invincible and Other Stories\"). A translation into German was published in 1967; an English translation  by Wendayne Ackerman, based on the German one, was published in 1973. A direct translation into English from Polish, by Bill Johnston, was published in 2006.\nIt was one of the first novels to explore the ideas of microrobots, smartdust, artificial swarm intelligence, and \"necroevolution\" (a term suggested by Lem in the novel for the evolution of non-living matter).\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\nA heavily armed interstellar spacecraft called Invincible lands on the planet Regis III, which seems uninhabited and bleak, to investigate the loss of her sister ship, Condor. During the investigation, the crew finds evidence of a form of quasi-life, born through evolution of autonomous, self-replicating machines, apparently left behind by an alien civilization ship which landed on Regis III a very long time ago.\nThe protagonists come to speculate that a kind of evolution must have taken place under the selection pressures of \"robot wars\", with the only surviving form being swarms of minuscule, insect-like micromachines. Individually, or in small groups, they are quite harmless and capable of only very simple behavior. When threatened, they can assemble into huge clouds, travel at a high speed, and even climb to the top of the troposphere. These swarms display complex behavior arising from self-organization and can incapacitate any intelligent threat by a powerful surge of electromagnetic interference. Condor's crew suffered a complete memory erasure as a consequence of attacks from these \"clouds\". The swarm, however, is reactive. It lacks intelligence and cannot formulate attack strategies proact", "ively.\nInvincible's crew mounts an escalating series of attacks on the perceived enemy, but eventually recognizes the futility of their efforts. The robotic \"fauna\", dubbed \"necrosphere\", has become part of the planet's ecology, and would require a disruption on a planetary scale to be destroyed.\nIn the face of defeat and imminent withdrawal of the Invincible, Rohan, the spaceship's first navigator, undertakes a trip into the \"enemy area\" in search of four crew members who went missing in action \u2013 an attempt which he and the Invincible's commander Horpach see as certainly futile, but necessary for moral reasons. Rohan wanders into canyons covered by metallic \"shrubs\" and \"insects\", and finds some of the missing crewmen dead. He gathers some evidence and returns to the ship unharmed, thanks partially to a device that cloaks his brain activity and partially to his calm and nonthreatening behavior. Rohan expresses his intention to petition for preservation of the planet's artificial ecosystem, which fascinates him.\n\n\n== Commentary ==\nThe novel turns into an analysis of the relationship between different life domains, and their place in the Universe. In particular, it is an imaginary experiment to demonstrate that evolution may not necessarily lead to dominance by intellectually superior life forms.\nThe plot also involves a philosophical dilemma, juxtaposing the values of humanity and the efficiency of mechanical insects. Jarz\u0119bski comments that the novel demonstrates that the advantage of humans is not in the ability to annihilate of the enemy, but in the \"ability to stop\", to overcome the Darwinistic instinct of struggle for an advantage.\nTheodore Sturgeon praised The Invincible as \"SF in the grand tradition\", saying \"The Science is hard. The descriptions are vivid and powerful.\"\nThe idea of an \"ultimate weapon system\" was finalized by Lem in his 1983/1986 fictitious review \"Weapon Systems of the Twenty First Century or The Upside-down Evolution\".The themes of microro", "bots and smart dust from his faux review were used verbatim in his 1985 novel Peace on Earth, where Ijon Tichy reads chapters from the (faux) book.\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\nIn the late 1960s, Michael Redstone acquired the rights to a film adaptation of the novel, but he failed to find producers. In his usual grumpy manner Lem commented that \"it would probably have been awful, but I did earn a lot\".\nIn 1991, Swedish author Kerstin Ekman created a educational computer game titled Rymdresa, which is mainly based on The Invincible.\nIn 2019, Rafa\u0142 Miko\u0142ajczyk published the comic book Niezwyci\u0119\u017cony [The Invincible], ISBN 9788395521409. Reviewers note the faithful rendering of Lem's original novel by Miko\u0142ajczyk in a different media.\nIn 2020, Polish video game developer Starward Industries announced a video game adaptation of The Invincible. According to the developer, the adaptation is designed for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles. The game was released on November 6, 2023.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAbout the novel on the official Stanis\u0142aw Lem website (in English)\nAbout the novel on the official Stanis\u0142aw Lem website (different content) (in Polish)", "Invincible is an American comic book series written by Robert Kirkman, illustrated by Cory Walker and Ryan Ottley, and published by Image Comics.

The series is known for its extreme graphic violence despite its colorful nature and visuals.\nThe series ended with issue #144, with Ryan Ottley \"coming back to the book\" for the final twelve-issue sequence.

J. Su (cancelled at #6), the 3-issue Capes Inc. series drawn by Mark Englert and three oneshots starring Brit, the first two with artwork from Tony Moore and the third with artwork by Cliff Rathburn.\nIn 2007, Brit was launched as an ongoing full-color series written by Bruce Brown, with artwork by Cliff Rathburn. The series was overseen and edited by Robert Kirkman. In late 2007, a two issue mini-series starring Atom Eve was released.\nTech Jacket was first collected as a digest-sized, black and white graphic novel and later reissued in regular sized, full color and a cover scheme similar to Kirkman's other trade paper backs. Capes was collected as a trade paperback in summer 2007, and the three Brit one-shots were colored by Val Staples and published as a collection in 2007, as well.\nAt first shown to barely coexist in the same universe, the characters have since been integrated into Invincible's book. Tech Jacket was an ongoing series that tied into Invincible #27, and the character has been seen in the background of various battles during the series. The characters from Capes have also been supporting characters seen mainly in large superhero battles Invincible participates in, and the series ran as a back-up in the Invincible book starting with #27. Brit has had an even less substantial role, appearing a couple of times in the aforementioned brawls (understandable considering that after the last book Brit was somewhat-retired).

Omni-Man is the father of Invincible and Oliver Grayson, and a member of the alien Viltrumite race, working as a superhero on Earth. Omni-Man appears in Supreme, Invincible, Noble Causes, and Dynamo 5.\nIn the Invincible television series and the video games Invincible: Guarding the Globe and Mortal Kombat 1, Omni-Man is voiced by J. K. Simmons.\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nOmni-Man (as Omniman) was first referenced in Alan Moore's and Chris Sprouse's Supreme: The Story of the Year (August 1996\u2013September 1997), in which the titular Supreme (in his civilian identity of Ethan Crane) would illustrate the adventures of Omniman. Robert Kirkman would officially introduce Omni-Man as the father of the titular character in his comic series Invincible (January 2003\u2013February 2018), redesigned by Cory Walker and Ryan Ottley as a black-haired, mustachioed man compared to his Supreme design of blonde hair and a clean-shaven face.\n\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\n\n\n=== Supreme ===\nIn Supreme: The Story of the Year, the superhero Supreme, as comic book author Ethan Crane, draws the adventures of Omniman. Omni-man's secret identity is Spencer Samson, with love interests Linda Lake and Lyra Lemuria. Later, supervillain Cyber-Zerk attacks Supreme's place of work in search of Omniman, assuming the comic to be accurate to life, and kidnap Omniman's creator and writer Diana Dane in an attempt to draw Omniman out, subsequently mistaking Supreme for Omniman. Later, Supreme encounters a real-life version of the Dazzle Comics Omniman in his office. After questioning their respective existences and accusing the other to be fictional, Omniman and Supreme decide to demonstrate each other's powers in a brawl, with Diana helping Supreme by providing background on Omnim", "an's powers. Ultimately, after breaking character, 'Omniman' reveals to himself to be the inter-dimensional Szazs, the Sprite Supreme, having imitated Supreme's Omniman in an attempt to win the Impolympics.\nFollowing a multiversal war and a subsequent \"revision\" of Earth's history in Erik Larsen's Supreme, set during the events of Invincible, the real Omni-Man faces an 'evil' Supreme after viciously beating Suprema into a coma and goes on a killing spree, murdering criminals to re-establish his position as the most powerful superhero on the planet, while Dane, the \"modern\" Supreme and other surviving Supremes of the Supremacy, having been stripped of their superpowers, adjust to their helplessness in ending \"mean\" Supreme's rampage. After bringing their fight to the moon, knocking the \"mean\" Supreme unconscious, Omni-Man is surprised when the \"mean\" Supreme is captured by Khromium, while on Earth, Dane and Supreme are amazed to see a real-life version of their character brought to life, after finding Dazzle Comics to no longer exist.\n\n\n=== Invincible ===\nIn Invincible, Omni-Man arrived on Earth in the 1980s, where he eventually adopted the secret identity of a best-selling author named Nolan Grayson. He married Debbie, whose life he had saved, and they had a son together named Mark Grayson. In issue number 7, Nolan lures Earth's premiere superhero team, the Guardians of the Globe, to their hideout in Utah, where he brutally murders all the members. It was later revealed that the Immortal, the Guardians' leader, had been resurrected by the supervillain duo the Mauler Twins in an attempt to brainwash and control him. Remembering Omni-Man's betrayal, Immortal tracked down Nolan and battled him in public, outing him as the murderer and villain he truly is before being killed yet again. Nolan reveals that he was sent to Earth as a conqueror for the Viltrum Empire, a revelation that was in stark contrast to his previous claims that his presence was to advance human techno", "logy and protect the Earth from extraterrestrial dangers. In a confrontation shortly thereafter, Omni-Man beats Mark to within an inch of his life, yet he refuses to kill him before he flees the planet.\nIt was further revealed that Nolan had found a new planet over which to rule, in the hopes of offsetting some of the consequences of his earthly failure. Nolan's rise to power, however, was entirely peaceful. The custom of the native inhabitants, the Mantis Aliens (an insectoid people who live entirely within a nine-month span), was to simply choose the oldest among them to act as their leader. As on Earth, Nolan has taken a native wife, Andressa, and sired a second son, Oliver (who subsequently begins to use the codename \"Kid Omni-Man\" when he accompanies Invincible back to Earth). The genetic differences between Viltrumites and the mantis-people were more apparent, though, than they were with humans. This caused the child to age much more slowly than his mother's species, but much faster than his father's.\nOmni-Man's attempts to appease the Viltrum Empire ended in failure with his defeat and capture at the hands of his own people. He was held captive in prison until the Empire was able to send the required Viltrumite executioners. His parting words to Mark were \"Read my books, Mark. My books...\" In a conversation with his tailor Art Rosenbaum, Mark learns that the books Nolan referred to were not his well-known travel books, but a series of failed science fiction \"novels\". While Arthur suspected that the stories were Viltrumite folklore, Mark quickly realized that they were, in fact, first-person accounts of Nolan's own missions to destroy potential threats to the Viltrum Empire, which could provide the secrets to defeating the Viltrumites.\nHe is later saved on the day of his execution by Allen the Alien, to whom he agrees to reveal the \"secret\": Viltrumites are a near-extinct race, with fewer than fifty pure-blood able individuals left. Emboldened by the incredibl", "e strength shown by his new ally, he begins a two-men campaign to eradicate Viltrum's supremacy. Embarking on adventures across the galaxy, they gather weapons and allies which will give them an advantage over the Viltrumites, before returning to Earth to collect Mark and Oliver. They are briefly waylaid by the Viltrumite champion Conquest, an old enemy of Invincible who is killed in the ensuing battle, but not before Mark is critically injured. Nolan spends the subsequent months bonding with Oliver while Mark heals.\nIn the final battle of the war, the anti-Viltrumite coalition is victorious, destroying the Viltrumite homeworld and scattering their enemies, although Nolan is badly wounded by the Viltrumite regent Thragg, who secretly relocates the surviving members of his race on Earth, planning to interbreed with humans to covertly rebuild the empire. Tensions mount when Thragg discovers that Nolan is a descendant of the long-dead Viltrumite king, and thus heir to the throne, provoking a fierce battle between them. Although Nolan is overpowered, the Viltrumites recognize him and rally behind him, forcing Thragg to flee. Nolan is subsequently crowned as ruler of the Viltrum Empire.\nNolan Grayson manages to overlook the Viltrumites on Earth and sees how the Viltrumites changed for the better and see Earth as their new home. Nolan learns that Anissa raped Mark, and is saddened at Oliver's death. In the final confrontation between the Viltrumites and Thragg's army, Nolan was killed by Thragg. In his last words to Mark, Nolan Grayson names Mark as his successor to be the Emperor of Viltrumites. In the future, his grandson (Marky) visits Nolan's grave and promises to live up to his father's legacy.\n\n\n=== Dynamo 5 ===\nIn Dynamo 5: Sins of the Father, Omni-Man (alongside Captain Dynamo, Supreme, and the Savage Dragon) defeats Dominex in combat thirty years prior to the series' events, in which Dominex's three sons seek to regain their family's honour (after their father ha", "d been spared from execution and sent him back to his home planet in shame) by fighting Invincible and the Dynamo 5.\n\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\nIn addition to having all the generic powers and abilities of a Viltrumite, Omni-Man ranks among the most powerful Viltrumites to ever exist, physically stronger than most and a master combatant with centuries of experience. He ranks among the most powerful beings in the universe. He has superhuman strength, able to easily lift immense amounts of weight, tear through virtually any matter and only continues to gradually grow stronger the more he struggles and ages. He has super speed, able to close tremendous distances in seconds and likewise react to the fastest of opponents. He is nigh-invulnerable, immune to all forms of illness or contamination and able to withstand physical harm from all but the strongest of dangers. He has an enhanced healing factor, able to recover from all damage he does sustain, except the most grievous harm to his heart or brain, in anywhere from minutes to a single day depending on the level of harm, with no lingering side-effects. He has nigh-limitless stamina, able to continue his exertions for long periods of time with no effect to his performance and endure any damage he does sustain unhindered. He is also able to levitate and fly. While still needing air, Omni-Man can endure weeks holding his breath and likewise can survive the vacuum of space unprotected, allowing for unaided interstellar travel. Omni-Man possesses an immense longevity. This stems from a decelerated aging process, gradually aging slower the older he gets, allowing him to retain his youthful health, vitality, conditioning, and appearance for an incalculably long time. At over two thousand years old, he has only begun to show signs of aging while still physically performing in his prime. Also as a Viltrumite, Omni-Man's genetics are so potent, they almost completely overshadow any genetics his offspring will inherit from the ", "other parent, making said offspring almost purely Viltrumite themselves.\n\n\n== In other media ==\n\n\n=== Television ===\nOmni-Man appears in the Invincible streaming television series, voiced by J. K. Simmons. He has received positive critical reception, spawning several internet memes.\n\n\n=== Video games ===\n\nOmni-Man, based on his appearance in the Invincible TV series, appears as a playable character in Mortal Kombat 1 via the \"Kombat Pack\" DLC, voiced again by J. K. Simmons.  In his arcade mode ending, which takes place after the first season of Invincible, Omni-Man is pulled from his native timeline by Titan Shang Tsung to help him fight Fire God Liu Kang. However, Omni-Man betrays and kills Titan Shang Tsung before leading Viltrumite forces in conquering the realms to make up for abandoning Earth, with the understanding that he will have to return to Earth someday to complete his original mission.\nOmni-Man appears as a cosmetic outfit in Fortnite Battle Royale.\nOmni-Man will appear as a playable character in the upcoming Invincible: Guarding the Globe.\n\n\n=== Miscellaneous ===\nOmni-Man appears in the Death Battle episode \"Omni-Man VS Homelander (Invincible VS the Boys)\", voiced by Tom Schalk, in which he fights and defeats Homelander from The Boys franchise.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nOmni-Man was ranked as IGN's 93rd-greatest comic book hero/villain of all time.

He is depicted as a psychopathic and sadistic narcissist who serves as the extremely powerful leader of The Seven\u2014a group of corrupt and hedonistic superheroes grown and funded by Vought-American\u2014and the archenemy of Billy Butcher. Beneath his public image as a noble and altruistic hero, the Homelander cares little about the well-being of those he professes to protect.\nIn the Amazon Prime Video television adaptation developed by Eric Kripke, Homelander is primarily portrayed by Antony Starr, with Rowan Smyth and Isaac Weeks portraying him as a child. This version is the megalomaniacal son of Soldier Boy and the father of Ryan, born as a result of Homelander raping Billy Butcher's wife Becca (a crime commited by Black Noir in the comic book series). Homelander has also appeared in the spin-off and promotional web series The Boys Presents: Diabolical and Death Battle!, respectively. Described as the living personification of how the world sees America, the character has received critical acclaim along with Starr's portrayal in the series. Homelander has been compared to Superman and Captain America.\n\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n\n=== Comic book series ===\nThe Homelander is a patriotic superhero who leads the superhero team, The Seven, and the most powerful superhuman created by Vought-American. The company's cover story for the Homelander is that he is an alien who landed in the United States as an infant, much like Superman. In reality, he and the rest of the original roster of the Seven were grown in a secret laboratory, the progeny of genetic material taken from Stormfront, who was injected with Compound V while still a member of the Hitler Youth. Homelander spent most of his young life chained down with a hydrogen bomb strapped to him in case he tried to escape. His mo", "ther was a mentally disabled woman who died giving birth to him.\nHomelander remains under the financial thumb of V, as their money funds the Seven's hedonistic lifestyle. Homelander eventually tries to encourage the other superheroes to do what they want, but relents due to his fear of his boss \"The Vought Guy\"/\"The Guy From Vought\".\nUntil the events of the series' climax, Billy Butcher is tricked into thinking Homelander had raped his wife Becky, who then died giving birth to a superhuman baby Butcher had then killed. In Issue #40, the Boys receive a series of incriminating doctored photos seemingly showing Homelander engaging in grisly acts of murder, cannibalism, and necrophilia against men, women, and children. In private, Homelander shows signs of suffering a mental breakdown, talking to his own reflection in a mirror, and having bouts of nausea. He eventually decides that he is damned anyway for the acts depicted in the photos, and decides to give in to any intrusive thoughts that cross his mind.\nFrom Herogasm onward, Homelander resolves to free himself and the superhero community from Vought-American's control. In Over the Hill with the Swords of a Thousand Men, he leads the other superheroes in a coup d'etat against the United States, launching an attack on the White House and killing everyone inside, including the President. During the subsequent confrontation between Homelander and Butcher, the masked Black Noir arrives in the Oval Office and reveals himself as a clone of Homelander (the first of the Seven grown after him), created solely to kill Homelander if he ever went rogue. Gradually driven insane due to not being allowed to kill Homelander, Noir reveals he committed the atrocities in the photos, including raping Butcher's wife, to trick the initially truly benevolent Homelander so that Noir would finally be allowed to fulfill his purpose. Outraged, Homelander attacks Black Noir. The remainder of their fight takes place off-panel, with a greatly inju", "red Noir reappearing several pages later holding the headless remains of Homelander's torso, before being killed himself by Billy Butcher.\n\n\n=== Television series ===\n\n\n==== The Boys (2019\u2013present) ====\nIn the television adaptation, Antony Starr plays Homelander as an adult, with Rowan Smyth playing him as a child in the first season, and Isaac Weeks playing him as a child in the fourth season. As interpreted within the television series, he is considered by some reviewers to be analogous to DC's Superman. Grown from the DNA samples taken from Soldier Boy's semen by Jonah Vogelbaum and having been reared in a laboratory environment to become Homelander, John Gillman displays many sociopathic tendencies and is openly contemptuous of those he considers lesser beings.\nHe is also highly self-righteous, delusional, possessive, paranoid, vindictive, insecure, insensitive, hypocritical, reckless with his powers, and incapable of accepting the possibility of any flaw in his person or decision-making. Unlike in the comic series, Homelander rapes Butcher's wife after she has been assigned as his assistant. However, he left her alive and, though he was unaware of it until the end of the season, pregnant with his son, Ryan. His discovery of the lies surrounding Ryan's existence influences his decision to maim the scientist responsible for his upbringing, Jonah Vogelbaum, and murder Madelyn Stillwell. However, his emotional incompetence and sociopathic traits initially alienate him from his son, and the loss of Stillwell's moderating influence on his behavior unbalances him further. He enters a sexual relationship with Stormfront, despite a difficult beginning, and conspires with her to remove his son from Becca's care and turn the public against \"supervillains,\" creating public outcry for the creation of more superheroes. Stormfront is critically injured by Homelander's son Ryan and Maeve blackmails Homelander into letting the boy go and leaving her alone.\nIn a series of televi", "sion interviews, he is forced to denounce his relationship with Stormfront and apologize for his actions. Partly to moderate Homelander's behavior, CEO Stan Edgar and Vought's board of directors install Starlight as co-captain of The Seven. However, in response to this, Homelander bribes Edgar's secret adoptive daughter Victoria Neuman into opening an investigation into Edgar, ousting him from Vought, with Homelander assuming control of the company himself. Before leaving, Edgar warns Homelander that he will not be here to clean up his messes. He appoints Ashley Barrett as his puppet ruler and antagonizes Starlight by reinstating The Deep as a member of the Seven and falsely announcing that the two are in a relationship during the finale of American Hero. After Starlight denounces Homelander and Vought and abandons her persona as Starlight via a livestream, Homelander says that he dumped her and accuses her of engaging in human trafficking via her charitable foundation, the Starlight House. After learning that Queen Maeve not only acted as an informant for the Boys but also slept with their leader Billy Butcher, Homelander has her detained at Seven Tower with the intention of harvesting her eggs. Homelander later learns of his connection with Soldier Boy after receiving a call from him. After confirming this connection with Black Noir, Homelander savagely murders the latter. He later picks up Ryan from Mallory's house after intimidating her. When Homelander attempts to connect with Soldier Boy by introducing him to Ryan and saying that all three of them could be a family, Soldier Boy disowns him as a weak, damaged, attention-seeking disappointment and attempts to kill or depower him (as part of his deal with Butcher). Homelander turns against Soldier Boy after the latter strikes Ryan, but is forced to reluctantly fight Queen Maeve. He later introduces his son Ryan to his and Stormfront's supporters at Vought Tower. There, a pro-Starlight protestor hits Ryan in the f", "ace with a soft drink can, provoking Homelander to kill him with his heat vision. This grants him the applause of his and Stormfront's supporters, while Ryan is impressed.\nHomelander, after getting everything he's ever wanted, faces a murder trial and begins to have a breakdown, so he recruits Sister Sage to help him. On the day of the trial, he orders three of his fans to be killed to start a brawl right after being declared innocent. He organizes the first rescue of his son Ryan, forcing him to use his power by killing the false criminal. After trying to kill Hughie, he has a fight with Ryan for seeing Butcher and has a mental breakdown. He then visits the lab where he was created  and kept locked up. He proceeds to kill all of the people responsible for testing on him in an act of revenge, with the exception of Dr. Barbara Findlay, whom he leaves locked up along with the rest of the dead staff. Following the events at the lab, Homelander begins to connect with Ryan and starts to support him. Later, Homelander tells his team that they will have to be more cruel and ruthless for the greater good just before he orders The Seven to kill Cameron Coleman, who is believed to have leaked the video. Homelander, along with most of The Seven and Neuman, attend a party organized by Tek Knight, in which he plans to turn, along with Sage and Neuman, the congressmen against Singer. Homelander learns from Firecracker that the mole is still alive and they become intimate when she feeds him her breast milk. Homelander begins to give Firecracker more weight on the team. Homelander kills Webweaver thinking he is the mole and sends The Deep and Black Noir II to kill Butcher and the rest of The Boys, without success. Feeling betrayed by A-Train, Homelander expels Sage from The Seven after hiding that A-Train was the mole. That night, Homelander sees how his son talks live about his mother Becca and Butcher, which leaves him in shock. Homelander discovers Butcher's gift and in a rage d", "estroys his apartment and scolds Ryan making him leave. Afterwards, Homelander reveals Neuman as Super and orders The Seven to kill everyone in Vought who knows about his dirty laundry. When Neuman dies, Sage reveals to him that it was all part of his plan and the new presidential candidate, Senator Coulhon, swears allegiance to him and proclaims martial law commanded by Homelander and his superhuman army.\n\n\n==== Gen V (2023\u2013present) ====\nHomelander appears during the chaos at Godolkin University in the first season finale of Gen V after being called by Ashley Barrett. Upon arrival, he sees the fallen Supes from the \"Woods\" and Cate Dunlap's left arm being blasted off as he asks Marie what kind of Supe attacks her own kind. Before Marie can explain, Homelander blasts his heat vision at her. After this, he makes the real perpetrators of the attack the ones who saved the day and Marie and her group are locked up. Homelander watches his cover-up be mentioned by Cameron Coleman with satisfaction.\n\n\n==== Seven on 7 (2020\u20132021) ====\nIn the following 2020\u20132021 promotional web series, Seven on 7 with Cameron Coleman, which bridges the events of the second and third seasons, Homelander continues dealing with the aftermath of Stormfront being revealed to be a Nazi, as well as filming promos for Vought's streaming service, Vought+, and to celebrate Christmas.\n\n\n==== Death Battle! (2020\u2013present) ====\nIn the 2020 Amazon Prime Video-sponsored The Boys promotional episodes of Death Battle!, in promotion for its second season, Homelander (voiced by Yong Yea) participates in the Seven's simulated battle royale, declaring himself the winner after killing Billy Butcher (standing-in for Black Noir), before throwing aside the laser baby to fight Stormfront, a consequence of which Wiz and Boomstick are uneasy of.\nIn a 2022 episode, Homelander is pitted against Nolan Grayson / Omni-Man (from Invincible). Through a simulated battle, the hosts determined Omni-Man's superior strength, skill,", " and experience would prevail against Homelander if the two fought to the death.\n\n\n==== The Boys Presents: Diabolical (2022\u2013present) ====\nIn The Boys Presents: Diabolical, Starr reprises his role as Homelander from the live-action series.\nHomelander first appears in the final moments of the episode \"An Animated Short Where Pissed-Off Supes Kill Their Parents\", executing the title characters (escaped Supe teenagers with abnormal powers from the Red River Assisted Living for the Gifted Child) with his heat vision on Vought's behalf, after they kill their parents due to the events of The Boys episode \"Over the Hill with the Swords of a Thousand Men\". Ghost was the only survivor of the attack. Vought covered up all the deaths that were caused where one news report states that Homelander saved Ghost's mother from a \"natural gas explosion\" that took the life of Ghost's dad.\nHomelander next appears in the episode \"I'm Your Pusher\", set in the same continuity as The Boys comic book series while honoring Great Wide Wonder during a promotional campaign. Homelander witnesses his drug overdose (induced by Billy Butcher) lead him to crash into Ironcast during a stunt, killing them both. In order to cover up what happened, Homelander, Queen Maeve, and Jack from Jupiter blame a \"Cold War satellite\" controlled by the evil Galaxius for their deaths claiming it is \"hidden in the light of the Sun\" which the watching crowd eagerly believed as they flew away.\nIn the season finale, the prequel episode \"One Plus One Equals Two\", a young Homelander makes his debut as a member of the Seven. Flashbacks of his childhood reveal the systematic torture he received from Vought scientists testing the extent of his powers. His superior Madelyn Stillwell, who has been manipulating him, warns him of Black Noir, the \"Homelander before Homelander\", claiming that he will seek every opportunity to destroy him. Assigned to tackle a hostage situation at a chemical plant ahead of Noir as his first mission a", "s a superhero, Homelander attempts a peaceful resolution; however, after accidentally killing a hostage and injuring the eco-terrorist leader by lasering the latter's broken gun, he kills the remaining eco-terrorists and all but one hostage in a psychotic episode after they collectively berate him for his recklessness. After Black Noir arrives on the scene, Homelander attempts to explain his actions before resolving to kill Noir to cover them up. After Noir tricks Homelander into blowing up the compound, he gains his trust by mercy killing the last witness to Homelander's murders in its aftermath, and writes him an excusatory speech to provide to the press outside, claiming the eco-terrorists had a bomb. Everyone bought that speech. Later at Vought headquarters, Homelander tells Stillwell that she was wrong about Noir.\n\n\n== Development ==\nThe character was designed as an evil version of Superman and Captain America in terms of powerset and costume. His cape pulled to the left resembles the first costume of Captain Marvel a.k.a. Shazam. Homelander's backstory in the original comics is similar to that in the television adaption of The Boys.\nGarth Ennis describes Homelander as: \"an almost entirely negative character. He is really just a series of unpleasant urges kept in check by his own intelligence, which is enough to understand that he can have anything he wants so long as he doesn't push his luck too far.\" Also: \"It might help to think of the Homelander as having all the self-control of... let's say... a fourteen-year-old.\"\nThe Boys producer and showrunner Eric Kripke has stated that while Homelander can \"in theory\" be killed, a plot twist which involved the character being killed by his clone Black Noir in the comic book version was not used in the television adaptation, where Black Noir is instead depicted as a black man and the character's psychopathic traits are amalgamated with Homelander.\n\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\nIn The Boys comics, Homelander's powers in", "clude heat vision, super strength, super speed, durability, flight, regenerative healing factor, super hearing and enhanced vocal cords. He also ages slower than a normal human, due to Compound V. Homelander additionally has X-ray vision, which enables him to see through anything except items made out of, or lined with zinc, a reference to Superman's inability to see through lead. Compound V can also bring life back to a dead brain, but limits the cognitive abilities of the user.\nHe is much stronger than everyone else in The Boys universe. \nIn the television series, The Boys, in the first season finale \"You Found Me\", when asked about Homelander's weakness, Madelyn Stillwell claims he does not have one, saying, \"There isn't a weapon on Earth that they haven't thrown at him. They've all failed.\" The Homelander's powers and sense of entitlement have led him to exhibit extreme megalomania, causing him to commit crimes against innocent people, including acts of rape and mass murder, out of the idea that he can do anything he wants because of who he is.\n\n\n== In other media ==\n\n\n=== Video games ===\n\nHomelander appears in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, voiced by Antony Starr.\nHomelander, based on Antony Starr's likeness, appears in Mortal Kombat 1 via the \"Kombat Pack\" DLC, voiced by Jake Green. In November 2023, prior to Homelander's addition, Starr revealed that while he would be providing his likeness for the game, he would not be voicing the character. In his arcade mode ending, Homelander starts to lay waste to America until a portal from the Mortal Kombat universe opens and a demon horde emerges from it. After destroying them and regaining public favor, he travels through the portal to take part in the Mortal Kombat tournament.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nMetro Boomin samples a section of Homelander's speech from the third season episode \"The Only Man In The Sky\" in his track \"On Time\" from his 2022 album Heroes & Villains.\nHomelander makes a cameo appearance in the music vide", "o for \"Roll Out the Fallout!\", a song performed by the Chalkeaters feat. Black Gryph0n & Benny Benack III.\n\n\n== References ==", "Invincible Presents: Atom Eve is a 2023 video game developed by Terrible Posture Games and published by Skybound Games.

It combines gameplay of role-playing games and visual novels with music and songs provided by Canadian electro-pop duo Milk & Bone. The game was released on November 14, 2023, and received positive reviews.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nIn Invincible Presents: Atom Eve, players control the titular character, Atom Eve. Eve's powers are customizable using a skill tree and make choices in a branching narrative.  Certain dialogue choices can affect the plot and are timed. Players earn experience points when defeating foes and completing quests. Combat is turn-based, and choices players make regarding Eve's powers affect what options they have access to. For example, prioritizing superpowers that make dialogue easier can leave Eve with fewer options in combat. During combat, Eve has awareness of her enemies' next move. Players can counter these attacks by spending energy to perform their own attacks. If Eve has leftover energy, it is added to her next turn.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nIn a flashback, Samantha Eve Wilkins / Atom Eve battles against the villain Killcannon and defeats him. She is then asked by fellow superhero Robot to join his group, the Teen Team. Eve returns home and is forced to reveal her superhero identity to her parents. One year later, during a patrol, Eve spots a green female alien flying in the air, though she is forced to deal with Killcannon once more. Eve quickly dispatches of him, before letting the Teen Team take care of the situation. The next day, Eve begins her senior year at high school. The Teen Team responds to a robbery committed by the Mauler Twins, where they are assisted by a mysterious pajama-wearing superhero who", " calls himself Invincible. The next day, at school, Eve encounters fellow student Mark Grayson, who reveals himself to her as Invincible. The two of them befriend one another, as well as Mark's friends William Clockwell and Amber Bennett.\nLater, Eve encounters one of the students at her school, Todd, who has a chemical bomb crudely grafted to his chest. Eve can either defuse the bomb in time or prioritize saving nearby citizens, resulting in Todd's death. Regardless of the outcome, Eve proceeds to investigate the origin of the bomb. Her investigation is cut short by reports of disturbance at the city's power plant. Eve arrives and finds the green alien she encountered earlier, who is siphoning energy from the plant's reactor. The alien, calling herself Universa the Warrior Queen, battles Eve, while claiming that her world is dying and that she needs the energy from Earth to save it. Eve defeats Universa and destroys her staff, knocking her unconscious. Robot arrives and apprehends Universa, though he does not allow Eve to pry further on Universa's story. As Eve's investigation on the bomb goes further, she soon discovers that her chemistry teacher, Hiles, was the one who created the bomb, and she was working together with the Mauler Twins. Teaming up with Mark, Eve defeats the Twins, then later makes a choice whether to let Hiles commit suicide with her own bomb, or stop her from doing so. Regardless of the outcome, Robot confiscates Hiles' bomb design blueprints, though he is forced by Eve to promise a chance to speak to Universa later.\nOn graduation day, Eve, Mark, William and Amber celebrate going to college, though Eve admits that she did not send in any applications, as the choice did not appeal to her. Their celebration is cut short by news of the deaths of the Guardians of the Globe, the world's leading superhero team. Eve and Mark attend the Guardians' funeral, but Eve becomes frustrated when her boyfriend, fellow Teen Team member Rex Sloan / Rex Splode, fai", "ls to attend. She later finds out that Rex has been cheating on her with another team member, Kate Cha / Dupli-Kate, due to growing jealousy of Eve's friendship with Mark. Heartbroken, Eve breaks up with Rex.\nSome time later, Robot informs Eve that he has been selected by the Global Defense Agency to lead a new chapter of the Guardians, which also means the disbanding of the Teen Team. Eve declines Robot's offer to join the new Guardians. Returning home, Eve argues with her parents about her breakup with Rex, then furiously leaves them as she goes to the suburbs, where she creates a treehouse to take refuge. The next day, Eve is contacted by Cecil Stedman, director of the GDA, who reveals that Universa wishes to speak with her. However, their conversation is interrupted, as Eve then learns Mark is embroiled in a battle against his father, Nolan / Omni-Man. Eve attempts to go help Mark, but is stopped by the villain Doc Seismic. Eve deals with Seismic, but then finds that Omni-Man has retreated into space, while Mark has been hospitalized.\nSome time after the incident, Eve reunites with William and Amber, the latter of whom has broken up with Mark due to him constantly canceling their dates. As Amber begins to figure out Mark and Invincible are the same person, Eve contemplates disclosing her superhero persona to both Amber and William. Eve goes to a GDA prison facility and meets with Cecil, who lets her into Universa's cell. Universa pleads with Eve to recover her Staff of Leadership, so that she may leave the planet and search for other resources for her people. Eve finds one half of the staff in Killcannon's possession, and the other at the power plant. Eve recovers both pieces and mends them back together.\nAfter visiting a recovering Mark at his home, Eve takes Universa's staff back to the GDA prison, but Universa escapes her cell and takes the staff with her. Eve begins preparation to face off against Universa one final time, while also accepting Robot's offer f", "or assistance. Eve returns to the power plant, where she battles both Killcannon and Universa. Ultimately, Eve can make a choice whether to trust Universa and help her siphon energy from the power plant's reactor, or help the GDA apprehend her. In the aftermath of the battle, Eve returns to her treehouse, hopeful for the future.\n\n\n== Development ==\nSkybound Games released Invincible Presents: Atom Eve for Windows on November 14, 2023, developed by Terrible Posture Games who previously worked with Skybound on The Walking Dead: Last Mile.

RPGFan liked that it could be played without knowledge of the comic book or animated series. They found it a bit short but praised the gameplay, characters, soundtrack, and visuals.  Though Shacknews said Atom Eve \"sticks to some predictable superhero tropes\", they praised the story. They also enjoyed the gameplay and said the role-playing elements helped differentiate it from other visual novels. Sports Illustrated said it is not as good as the animated series but is worth playing.\n\n\n== References ==", "Gillian MacLaren Jacobs (; born October 19, 1982) is an American actress.

Panels are often accompanied by descriptive prose and written narrative, usually, dialogue contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form.\nComic Cuts was a British comic published from 1890 to 1953. It was preceded by Ally Sloper's Half Holiday (1884) which is notable for its use of sequential cartoons to unfold narrative. These British comics existed alongside the popular lurid \"penny dreadfuls\" (such as Spring-heeled Jack), boys' \"story papers\" and the humorous Punch magazine which was the first to use the term \"cartoon\" in its modern sense of a humorous drawing.\nThe first modern American-style comic book, Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics, was released in the U.S. in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term comic book derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.\nThe largest comic book market is Japan. By 1995, the manga market in Japan was valued at \u00a5586.4 billion ($6\u20137 billion), with annual sales of 1.9 billion manga books (tank\u014dbon volumes and manga magazines) in Japan, equivalent to 15 issues per person. In 2020 the manga market in Japan reached a new record value of \u00a5612.5 billion due to a fast growth of digital manga sales as well as an increase in print sales. The comic book market in the United States and Canada was valued at $1.09 billion in 2016. As of 2017, the largest comic book publisher in the United States is manga distributor Viz Media, followed by DC Comics and Marvel Comics featuring superhero comics franchises such as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk and t", "he X-Men. The best-selling comic book categories in the US as of 2019 are juvenile children's fiction at 41%, manga at 28% and superhero comics at 10% of the market. Another major comic book market is France, where Franco-Belgian comics and Japanese manga each represent 40% of the market, followed by American comics at 10% market share.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nComic books heavily rely on their organization and visual presentation. Authors dedicate significant attention to aspects like page layout, size, orientation, and the positioning of panels. These characteristics are crucial for effectively conveying the content and messages within the comic book. Key components of comic books encompass panels, speech bubbles (also known as balloons), text lines, and characters. Speech balloons generally take the form of convex containers that hold character dialogue and are connected to the character via a tail element. The tail comprises an origin, path, tip, and directional point. The creation of comic books involves several essential steps: writing, drawing, and coloring. Various technological tools and methods are employed to craft comic books, incorporating concepts such as directions, axes, data, and metrics. Following these formatting guidelines, the process unfolds with writing, drawing, and coloring. In the United States, the term \"comic book\", is generally used for comics periodicals and trade paperbacks while \"graphic novel\" is the term used for standalone books.\n\n\n== American comic books ==\n\nComics as a print medium have existed in the United States since the printing of The Adventures of Mr. Obadiah Oldbuck in 1842 in hardcover, making it the first known American prototype comic book. Proto-comics periodicals began appearing early in the 20th century, with the first comic standard-sized comic being Funnies on Parade. Funnies on Parades was the first book that established the size, duration, and format of the modern comic book. Following this was, Dell Publishing's 36-p", "age Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics as the first true newsstand American comic book; Goulart, for example, calls it \"the cornerstone for one of the most lucrative branches of magazine publishing\". In 1905 G.W. Dillingham Company published 24 select strips by the cartoonist Gustave Verbeek in an anthology book called 'The Incredible Upside-Downs of Little Lady Lovekins and Old Man Muffaroo'. The introduction of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's Superman in 1938 turned comic books into a major industry and ushered in the Golden Age of Comic Books. The Golden Age originated the archetype of the superhero. According to historian Michael A. Amundson, appealing comic-book characters helped ease young readers' fear of nuclear war and neutralize anxiety about the questions posed by atomic power.\nHistorians generally divide the timeline of the American comic book into eras. The Golden Age of Comic Books began in 1938, with the debut of Superman in Action Comics #1, published by Detective Comics (predecessor of DC Comics), which is generally considered the beginning of the modern comic book as it is known today. The Silver Age of Comic Books is generally considered to date from the first successful revival of the then-dormant superhero form, with the debut of the Flash in Showcase #4 (Oct. 1956). The Silver Age lasted through the late 1960s or early 1970s, during which time Marvel Comics revolutionized the medium with such naturalistic superheroes as Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's Fantastic Four and Lee and Steve Ditko's Spider-Man. The demarcation between the Silver Age and the following era, the Bronze Age of Comic Books, is less well-defined, with the Bronze Age running from the very early 1970s through the mid-1980s. The Modern Age of Comic Books runs from the mid-1980s to the present day.\nA significant event in the timeline of American comic books occurred when psychiatrist Fredric Wertham voiced his criticisms of the medium through his book Seduction of the Innocent (1954)", ". This critique led to the involvement of the American Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency, which launched an investigation into comic books. Wertham argued that comic books were accountable for a surge in juvenile delinquency and posed a potential impact on a child's sexuality and moral values. In response to attention from the government and from the media, the US comic book industry set up the Comics Magazine Association of America. The CMAA instilled the Comics Code Authority in 1954 and drafted the self-censorship Comics Code that year, which required all comic books to go through a process of approval. It was not until the 1970s that comic books could be published without passing through the inspection of the CMAA. The Code was made formally defunct in November 2011.\n\n\n=== Underground comic books ===\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, a surge of creativity emerged in what became known as underground comix. Published and distributed independently of the established comics industry, most of such comics reflected the youth counterculture and drug culture of the time. Underground comix \"reflected and commented on the social divisions and tensions of American society\". Many had an uninhibited, often irreverent style; their frank depictions of nudity, sex, profanity, and politics had no parallel outside their precursors, the pornographic and even more obscure \"Tijuana bibles\". Underground comics were almost never sold at newsstands, but rather in such youth-oriented outlets as head shops and record stores, as well as by mail order. The underground comics encouraged creators to publish their work independently so that they would have full ownership rights to their characters.\nFrank Stack's The Adventures of Jesus, published under the name Foolbert Sturgeon, has been credited as the first underground comix; while R. Crumb and the crew of cartoonists who worked on Zap Comix popularized the form.\n\n\n=== Alternative comics ===\n\nThe rise of comic book specialty st", "ores in the late 1970s created and paralleled a dedicated market for \"independent\" or \"alternative comics\" in the US. The first such comics included the anthology series Star Reach, published by comic book writer Mike Friedrich from 1974 to 1979, and Harvey Pekar's American Splendor, which continued sporadic publication into the 21st century and which Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini adapted into a 2003 film. Some independent comics continued in the tradition of underground comics. While their content generally remained less explicit, others resembled the output of mainstream publishers in format and genre but were published by smaller artist-owned companies or by single artists. A few (notably RAW) represented experimental attempts to bring comics closer to the status of fine art.\nDuring the 1970s the \"small press\" culture grew and diversified. By the 1980s, several independent publishers \u2013 such as Pacific, Eclipse, First, Comico, and Fantagraphics \u2013 had started releasing a wide range of styles and formats\u2014from color-superhero, detective, and science-fiction comic books to black-and-white magazine-format stories of Latin American magical realism.\nA number of small publishers in the 1990s, changed the format and distribution of their comics to more closely resemble non-comics publishing. The \"minicomics\" form, an extremely informal version of self-publishing, arose in the 1980s and became increasingly popular among artists in the 1990s, despite reaching an even more limited audience than the small press.\nSmall publishers regularly releasing titles include Avatar Press, Hyperwerks, Raytoons, and Terminal Press, buoyed by such advances in printing technology as digital print-on-demand.\n\n\n=== Graphic novels ===\n\nIn 1964, Richard Kyle coined the term \"graphic novel\".\nPrecursors of the form existed by the 1920s, which saw a revival of the medieval woodcut tradition by Belgian Frans Masereel, American Lynd Ward and others, including Stan Lee.\nIn 1947, Fawcett Publ", "ications published \"Comics Novel No. 1\", as the first in an intended series of these \"comics novels\". The story in the first issue was \"Anarcho, Dictator of Death\", a five chapter spy genre tale written by Otto Binder and drawn by Al Carreno. It is readable online in the Digital Comic Museum. The magazine never reached a second issue.\nIn 1950, St. John Publications produced the digest-sized, adult-oriented \"picture novel\" It Rhymes with Lust, a 128-page digest by pseudonymous writer \"Drake Waller\" (Arnold Drake and Leslie Waller), penciler Matt Baker and inker Ray Osrin, touted as \"an original full-length novel\" on its cover. \"It Rhymes with Lust\" is also available to read online in the Digital Comic Museum.\nIn 1971, writer-artist Gil Kane and collaborators applied a paperback format to their \"comics novel\" Blackmark. Will Eisner popularized the term \"graphic novel\" when he used it on the cover of the paperback edition of his work A Contract with God, and Other Tenement Stories in 1978 and, subsequently, the usage of the term began to increase.\n\n\n=== Digital comics ===\n\n\n=== Market size ===\nIn 2017, the comic book market size for North America was just over $1 billion with digital sales being flat, book stores having a 1 percent decline, and comic book stores having a 10 percent decline over 2016. The global comic book market saw a substantial 12% growth in 2020, reaching a total worth of US$8.49 billion. This positive trajectory continued in 2021, with the market's annual valuation surging to US$9.21 billion. The rising popularity of comic books can be attributed to heightened global interest, driven significantly by collaborative efforts among diverse brands. These collaborations are geared towards producing more engaging and appealing comic content, contributing to the industry's continued growth.\n\n\n=== Comic book collecting ===\n\nThe 1970s saw the advent of specialty comic book stores. Initially, comic books were marketed by publishers to children because comic b", "ooks were perceived as children's entertainment. However, with increasing recognition of comics as an art form and the growing pop culture presence of comic book conventions, they are now embraced by many adults.\nComic book collectors often exhibit a lifelong passion for the stories within comics, often focusing on specific superheroes and striving to gather a complete collection of a particular series. Comics are assigned sequential numbers, and the initial issue of a long-lasting comic book series tends to be both the scarcest and the most coveted among collectors. The introduction of a new character might occur within an existing title. For instance, the first appearance of Spider-Man took place in Amazing Fantasy #15. New characters were frequently introduced in this manner, waiting for an established audience before launching their own titles. Consequently, comics featuring the debut appearance of a significant character can sometimes be even more challenging to locate than the inaugural issue of that character's standalone series.\nSome rare comic books include copies of the unreleased Motion Picture Funnies Weekly #1 from 1939. Eight copies, plus one without a cover, emerged in the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974. The \"Pay Copy\" of this book sold for $43,125 in a 2005 Heritage auction.\nThe most valuable American comics have combined rarity and quality with the first appearances of popular and enduring characters. Four comic books have sold for over US$1 million as of December 2010, including two examples of Action Comics #1, the first appearance of Superman, both sold privately through online dealer ComicConnect.com in 2010, and Detective Comics #27, the first appearance of Batman, via public auction.\nUpdating the above price obtained for Action Comics #1, the first appearance of Superman, the highest sale on record for this book is $3.2 million, for a 9.0 copy. \nMisprints, promotional comic-dealer incentive printings, and issues with exceptionally lo", "w distribution tend to possess scarcity value in the comic book market. The rarest modern comic books include the original press run of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen #5, which DC executive Paul Levitz recalled and pulped due to the appearance of a vintage Victorian era advertisement for \"Marvel Douche\", which the publisher considered offensive; only 100 copies exist, most of which have been CGC graded. (See Recalled comics for more pulped, recalled, and erroneous comics.)\nIn 2000, a company named Comics Guaranty (CGC) initiated the practice of \"slabbing\" comics, which involves encasing them within thick plastic cases and assigning them a numerical grade. This approach inspired the emergence of Comic Book Certification Service. Given the significance of condition in determining the value of rare comics, the concept of grading by an impartial company, one that does not engage in buying or selling comics, seemed promising. Nevertheless, there is an ongoing debate regarding whether the relatively high cost of this grading service is justified and whether it serves the interests of collectors or mainly caters to speculators seeking rapid profits, akin to trading in stocks or fine art. Comic grading has played a role in establishing standards for valuation, which online price guides such as GoCollect and GPAnalysis utilize to provide real-time market value information.\nCollectors also seek out the original artwork pages from comic books, which are perhaps the most rarefied items in the realm of comic book collecting. These pages hold unparalleled scarcity due to the fact that there exists only one unique page of artwork for every page that was printed and published.\nThe creation of these original artwork pages involves a collaborative effort: a writer crafts the story, a pencil artist designs the sequential panels on the page, an ink artist goes over the pencil with pen and ink, a letterer provides the dialogue and narration through hand-lettering, and finally, a ", "colorist adds color as the final touch before the pages are sent to the printer.\nWhen the printer returns the original artwork pages, they are typically returned to the artists themselves. These artists sometimes opt to sell these pages at comic book conventions, in galleries, and at art shows centered around comic book art. The original pages from DC and Marvel, featuring the debut appearances of iconic characters such as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, the Flash, Captain Marvel, Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America and the Mighty Thor are regarded as priceless treasures within the comic book world.\n\n\n=== History of race in U.S. comic books ===\n\nMany early iterations of black characters in comics \"became variations on the 'single stereotypical image of Sambo'.\" Sambo was closely related to the coon stereotype but had some subtle differences. They are both a derogatory way of portraying black characters. \"The name itself, an abbreviation of raccoon, is dehumanizing. As with Sambo, the coon was portrayed as a lazy, easily frightened, chronically idle, inarticulate, buffoon.\" This portrayal \"was of course another attempt to solidify the intellectual inferiority of the black race through popular culture.\" However, in the 1940s there was a change in portrayal of black characters. \"A cursory glance...might give the impression that situations had improved for African Americans in comics.\" In many comics being produced in this time there was a major push for tolerance between races. \"These equality minded heroes began to spring to action just as African Americans were being asked to participate in the war effort.\"\nDuring this time, a government ran program, the Writers' War Board, became heavily involved in what would be published in comics. \"The Writers' War Board used comic books to shape popular perceptions of race and ethnicity...\" Not only were they using comic books as a means of recruiting all Americans, they were also using it as propaganda to", " \"[construct] a justification for race-based hatred of America's foreign enemies.\" The Writers' War Board created comics books that were meant to \"[promote] domestic racial harmony\". However, \"these pro-tolerance narratives struggled to overcome the popular and widely understood negative tropes used for decades in American mass culture...\". However, they were not accomplishing this agenda within all of their comics.\nIn the comic series Captain Marvel Adventures, there was a character named Steamboat who embodied a collection of highly negative stereotypes prevalent during that period. The Writers' War Board did not request any alterations to this character despite the problematic portrayal. The removal of Steamboat from the series only came about due to the persistent advocacy of a black youth group based in New York City.\" Originally their request was refused by individuals working on the comic stating, \"Captain Marvel Adventures included many kinds of caricatures 'for the sake of humor'.\" The black youth group responded with \"this is not the Negro race, but your one-and-a-half millions readers will think it so.\" Afterwards, Steamboat disappeared from the comics all together. There was a comic created about the 99th Squadron, also known as the Tuskegee Airmen, an all-black air force unit. Instead of making the comic about their story, the comic was about Hop Harrigan. A white pilot who captures a Nazi, shows him videos of the 99th Squadron defeating his men and then reveals to the Nazi that his men were defeated by African Americans which infuriated him as he sees them as a less superior race and cannot believe they bested his men.\"The Tuskegee Airmen, and images of black aviators appear in just three of the fifty three panels... the pilots of the 99th Squadron have no dialogue and interact with neither Hop Harrigan nor his Nazi captive.\" During this time, they also used black characters in comic books as a means to invalidate the militant black groups that were fi", "ghting for equality within the U.S. \"Spider-Man 'made it clear that militant black power was not the remedy for racial injustice'.\" \"The Falcon openly criticized black behavior stating' maybe it's important fo [sic] us to cool things down-so we can protect the rights we been fightin' for'.\" This portrayal and character development of black characters can be partially blamed on the fact that, during this time, \"there had rarely been a black artist or writer allowed in a major comics company.\"\nAsian characters within comic books encountered similar prejudiced treatment as black characters did. They were subjected to dehumanizing depictions, with narratives often portraying them as \"incompetent and subhuman.\" In a 1944 edition of the publication United States Marines, there was a story titled The Smell of the Monkeymen. This narrative portrayed Japanese soldiers as brutish simians, and it depicted their concealed positions being betrayed by their repugnant body odor. Chinese characters received the same treatment. \"By the time the United States entered WWII, negative perceptions of Chinese were an established part of mass culture....\" However, concerned that the Japanese could use America's anti-Chinese material as propaganda they began \"to present a more positive image of America's Chinese allies...\" Just as they tried to show better representation for Black people in comics they did the same for Asian people. However, \"Japanese and Filipino characters were visually indistinguishable. Both groups have grotesque buckteeth, tattered clothing, and bright yellow skin.\" \"Publishers depicted America's Asian allies through derogatory images and language honed over the preceding decades.\" Asian characters were previously portrayed as, \"ghastly yellow demons\". During WWII, \"[every] major superhero worth his spandex devoted himself to the eradication of Asian invaders.\" There was \"a constant relay race in which one Asian culture merely handed off the baton of hatred to another ", "with no perceptible changes in the manner in which the characters would be portrayed.\"\n\"The only specific depiction of a Hispanic superhero did not end well. In 1975, Marvel gave us Hector Ayala (a.k.a The White Tiger).\" \"Although he fought for several years alongside the likes of much more popular heroes such as Spider-Man and Daredevil, he only lasted six years before sales of comics featuring him got so bad that Marvel had him retire. The most famous Hispanic character is Bane, a villain from Batman.\"\nThe Native American representation in comic books \"can be summed up in the noble savage stereotype\" \" a recurring theme...urged American indians to abandon their traditional hostility towards the United States. They were the ones painted as intolerant and disrespectful of the dominant concerns of white America\".\n\n\n== East Asian comics ==\n\n\n=== Japanese manga ===\n\nManga (\u6f2b\u753b) are comic books or graphic novels originating from Japan. Most manga conform to a style developed in Japan in the late 19th century, though the art form has a long prehistory in earlier Japanese art. The term manga is used in Japan to refer to both comics and cartooning in general. Outside Japan, the word is typically used to refer to comics originally published in the country.\n\n\n=== D\u014djinshi ===\n\nD\u014djinshi (\u540c\u4eba\u8a8c, fan magazine), fan-made Japanese comics, operate in a far larger market in Japan than the American \"underground comix\" market; the largest d\u014djinshi fair, Comiket, attracts 500,000 visitors twice a year.\n\n\n=== Korean manhwa ===\n\nManhwa (\ub9cc\ud654) are comic books or graphic novels originating from South Korea. The term manhwa is used in South Korea to refer to both comics and cartooning in general. Outside South Korea, the term usually refers to comics originally published in the country. Manhwa is greatly influenced by Japanese Manga comics though it differs from manga and manhua with its own distinct features.\n\n\n=== Webtoons ===\n\nWebtoons have become popular in South Korea as a new way to read ", "comics. Thanks in part to different censorship rules, color and unique visual effects, and optimization for easier reading on smartphones and computers. More manhwa have made the switch from traditional print manhwa to online webtoons thanks to better pay and more freedom than traditional print manhwa. The webtoon format has also expanded to other countries outside of Korea like China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Western countries. Major webtoon distributors include Lezhin, Naver, and Kakao.\n\n\n=== Chinese manhua ===\n\n\n=== Vietnamese truy\u1ec7n tranh ===\n\n\n== European comics ==\n\n\n=== Franco-Belgian comics ===\n\n \nFrance and Belgium have a long tradition in comics and comic books, often called BDs (an abbreviation of bandes dessin\u00e9es, meaning literally \"drawn strips\") in French, and strips in Dutch or Flemish. Belgian comic books originally written in Dutch show the influence of the Francophone \"Franco-Belgian\" comics but have their own distinct style.\n\n\n=== British comics ===\n\nAlthough Ally Sloper's Half Holiday (1884) was aimed at an adult market, publishers quickly targeted a younger demographic, which has led to most publications being for children and has created an association in the public's mind of comics as somewhat juvenile. The Guardian refers to Ally Sloper as \"one of the world's first iconic cartoon characters\", and \"as famous in Victorian Britain as Dennis the Menace would be a century later.\" British comics in the early 20th century typically evolved from illustrated penny dreadfuls of the Victorian era (featuring Sweeney Todd, Dick Turpin and Varney the Vampire). First published in the 1830s, penny dreadfuls were \"Britain's first taste of mass-produced popular culture for the young.\"\n\nThe two most popular British comic books, The Beano and The Dandy, were first published by DC Thomson in the 1930s. By 1950 the weekly circulation of both reached two million. Explaining the enormous popularity of comics in the UK during this period, Anita O'Brien, director cur", "ator at London's Cartoon Museum, states: \"When comics like the Beano and Dandy were invented back in the 1930s \u2013 and through really to the 1950s and 60s \u2013 these comics were almost the only entertainment available to children.\" Dennis the Menace was created in the 1950s, which saw sales for The Beano soar. He features in the cover of The Beano, with the BBC referring to him as the \"definitive naughty boy of the comic world.\"\nIn 1954, Tiger comics introduced Roy of the Rovers, the hugely popular football based strip recounting the life of Roy Race and the team he played for, Melchester Rovers. The stock media phrase \"real 'Roy of the Rovers' stuff\" is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or surprising results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip's trademark. Other comic books such as Eagle, Valiant, Warrior, Viz and 2000 AD also flourished. Some comics, such as Judge Dredd and other 2000 AD titles, have been published in a tabloid form. Underground comics and \"small press\" titles have also appeared in the UK, notably Oz and Escape Magazine.\nThe content of Action, another title aimed at children and launched in the mid-1970s, became the subject of discussion in the House of Commons. Although on a smaller scale than similar investigations in the US, such concerns led to a moderation of content published within British comics. Such moderation never became formalized to the extent of promulgating a code, nor did it last long. The UK has also established a healthy market in the reprinting and repackaging of material, notably material originating in the US. The lack of reliable supplies of American comic books led to a variety of black-and-white reprints, including Marvel's monster comics of the 1950s, Fawcett's Captain Marvel, and other characters such as Sheena, Mandrake the Magician, and the Phantom. Several reprint companies became involved in repackaging American ", "material for the British market, notably the importer and distributor Thorpe & Porter. Marvel Comics established a UK office in 1972. DC Comics and Dark Horse Comics also opened offices in the 1990s. The repackaging of European material has occurred less frequently, although The Adventures of Tintin and Asterix serials have been successfully translated and repackaged in softcover books. The number of European comics available in the UK has increased in the last two decades. The British company Cinebook, founded in 2005, has released English translated versions of many European series.\nIn the 1980s, a resurgence of British writers and artists gained prominence in mainstream comic books, which was dubbed the \"British Invasion\" in comic book history. These writers and artists brought with them their own mature themes and philosophy such as anarchy, controversy and politics common in British media. These elements would pave the way for mature and \"darker and edgier\" comic books and jump start the Modern Age of Comics. Writers included Alan Moore, famous for his V for Vendetta, From Hell, Watchmen, Marvelman, and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen; Neil Gaiman with The Sandman mythos and Books of Magic; Warren Ellis, creator of Transmetropolitan and Planetary; and others such as Mark Millar, creator of Wanted and Kick-Ass. The comic book series John Constantine, Hellblazer, which is largely set in Britain and starring the magician John Constantine, paved the way for British writers such as Jamie Delano.\nThe English musician Peter Gabriel issued in 2000 The Story of OVO which was released in a CD-booklet-shaped comic book as part of the CD edition with the title \"OVO The Millennium Show\". The 2000 Millennium Dome Show based on it.\nAt Christmas, publishers repackage and commission material for comic annuals, printed and bound as hardcover A4-size books; \"Rupert\" supplies a famous example of the British comic annual. DC Thomson also repackages The Broons and Oor Wullie s", "trips in softcover A4-size books for the holiday season.\nOn 19 March 2012, the British postal service, the Royal Mail, released a set of stamps depicting British comic book characters and series. The collection featured The Beano, The Dandy, Eagle, The Topper, Roy of the Rovers, Bunty, Buster, Valiant, Twinkle and 2000 AD.\n\n\n=== Spanish comics ===\nIt has been stated that the 13th century Cantigas de Santa Mar\u00eda could be considered as the first Spanish \"comic\", although comic books (also known in Spain as historietas or tebeos) made their debut around 1857. The magazine TBO was influential in popularizing the medium. After the Spanish Civil War, the Franco regime imposed strict censorship in all media: superhero comics were forbidden and as a result, comic heroes were based on historical fiction (in 1944 the medieval hero El Guerrero del Antifaz was created by Manuel Gago and another popular medieval hero, Capit\u00e1n Trueno, was created in 1956 by V\u00edctor Mora and Miguel Ambrosio Zaragoza). Two publishing houses \u2014 Editorial Bruguera and Editorial Valenciana \u2014 dominated the Spanish comics market during its golden age (1950\u20131970). The most popular comics showed a recognizable style of slapstick humor (influenced by Franco-Belgian authors such as Franquin): Escobar's Carpanta and Zipi y Zape, V\u00e1zquez's Las hermanas Gilda and Anacleto, Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez's Mortadelo y Filem\u00f3n and 13. Rue del Percebe or Jan's Superl\u00f3pez. After the end of the Francoist period, there was an increased interest in adult comics with magazines such as Totem, El Jueves, 1984, and El V\u00edbora, and works such as Paracuellos by Carlos Gim\u00e9nez.\nSpanish artists have traditionally worked in other markets finding great success, either in the American (e.g., Eisner Award winners Sergio Aragon\u00e9s, Salvador Larroca, Gabriel Hern\u00e1ndez Walta, Marcos Mart\u00edn or David Aja), the British (e.g., Carlos Ezquerra, co-creator of Judge Dredd) or the Franco-Belgian one (e.g., Fauve d'Or winner Julio Ribera or Blacksad authors Juan D\u00edaz ", "Canales and Juanjo Guarnido).\n\n\n=== Italian comics ===\n\nIn Italy, comics (known in Italian as fumetti) made their debut as humor strips at the end of the 19th century, and later evolved into adventure stories. After World War II, however, artists like Hugo Pratt and Guido Crepax exposed Italian comics to an international audience. Popular comic books such as Diabolik or the Bonelli line\u2014namely Tex Willer or Dylan Dog\u2014remain best-sellers.\nMainstream comics are usually published on a monthly basis, in a black-and-white digest size format, with approximately 100 to 132 pages. Collections of classic material for the most famous characters, usually with more than 200 pages, are also common. Author comics are published in the French BD format, with an example being Pratt's Corto Maltese.\nItalian cartoonists show the influence of comics from other countries, including France, Belgium, Spain, and Argentina. Italy is also famous for being one of the foremost producers of Walt Disney comic stories outside the US; Donald Duck's superhero alter ego, Paperinik, known in English as Superduck, was created in Italy.\n\n\n== Comics in other countries ==\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThe comic book industry has struggled with distribution issues throughout its history, as numerous mainstream retailers have been hesitant to stock substantial quantities of the most engaging and sought-after comics. The smartphone and the tablet have turned out to be an ideal medium for online distribution.\n\n\n=== Digital distribution ===\nOn 13 November 2007, Marvel Comics launched Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited, a subscription service allowing readers to read many comics from Marvel's history online. The service also includes periodic release new comics not available elsewhere. With the release of Avenging Spider-Man #1, Marvel also became the first publisher to provide free digital copies as part of the print copy of the comic book.\nWith the growing popularity of smartphones and tablets, many major publishers hav", "e begun releasing titles in digital form. The most popular platform is comiXology. Some platforms, such as Graphicly, have shut down.\n\n\n== Comic collections in libraries ==\nNumerous libraries house extensive collections of comics in the form of graphic novels. This serves as a convenient means for the general public to become acquainted with the medium.\n\n\n== Guinness World Records ==\nIn 2015, the Japanese manga artist Eiichiro Oda was awarded the Guinness World Records title for having the \"Most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author\". His manga series One Piece, which he writes and illustrates, has been serialized in the Japanese magazine Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump since December 1997, and by 2015, 77 collected volumes had been released. Guinness World Records reported in their announcement that the collected volumes of the series had sold a total of 320,866,000 units. One Piece also holds the Guinness World Records title for \"Most copies published for the same manga series\".\nOn 5 August 2018, the Guinness World Records title for the \"Largest comic book ever published\" was awarded to the Brazilian comic book Turma da M\u00f4nica \u2014 O Maior Gibi do Mundo!, published by Panini Comics Brasil and Mauricio de Sousa Produ\u00e7\u00f5es. The comic book measures 69.9 by 99.8 centimetres (2 feet 3.5 inches by 3 feet 3.3 inches). The 18-page comic book had a print run of 120 copies.\nWith the July 2021 publication of the 201st collected volume of his manga series Golgo 13, Japanese manga artist Takao Saito was awarded the Guinness World Records title for \"Most volumes published for a single manga series.\" Golgo 13 has been continuously serialized in the Japanese magazine Big Comic since October 1968, which also makes it the oldest manga still in publication.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCartoon\nComic book archive\nComic book therapy\nComics studies\nComics vocabulary\nComparison of image viewers\nHistory of comic books\nList of best-selling comic series\nList of best-selling manga\nWebcomic", "\nComic book grading\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nKern, Adam L.

Three 6-issue spin-off limited series were also produced during the series' original run: Herogasm, Highland Laddie, and Butcher, Baker, Candlestickmaker, with an 8-issue epilogue series, Dear Becky, published from June\u2013December 2020.\nThe book was adapted by Amazon Studios and Sony Pictures Television into a five-season television series that premiered July 26, 2019 on Amazon Prime Video, from which a franchise was launched\u2014web series Seven on 7 with Cameron Coleman, which premiered July 7, 2021\u2014spin-off animated anthology series, Diabolical, which premiered March 4, 2022 (of which the third episode, \"I'm Your Pusher\", is set in the same continuity as the comic series)\u2014and live-action spin-off series Gen V, which premiered September 29, 2023.\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nThe first six issues of The Boys were published by Wildstorm, starting in 2006. On January 24, 2007, the series was abruptly canceled with issue 6. Ennis later explained that this was because DC Comics (of which Wildstorm was an imprint before it was disbanded) were uneasy with the anti-superhero tone of the work. The planned collection of said issues was also canceled. Co-creator Darick Robertson said that \"DC is bei", "ng good about reverting our rights so we can find a new publisher and we're in the process of doing that now\". Ennis then released a statement that some other publishers had expressed interest, and that issue 7 and a trade paperback of the first six issues would be available. While Robertson was on exclusive contract to DC, he was given special dispensation to continue working on The Boys. In February 2007 the series was picked up by Dynamite Entertainment and it resumed in May, Dynamite also publishing a collected edition of the first six issues, The Name of the Game, with a foreword by Simon Pegg, the model on whom the character Wee Hughie was based in how he was drawn by Robertson.\nIn February 2009, Dynamite announced a spin-off miniseries, Herogasm, with art from John McCrea and Keith Burns; subsequent miniseries include Highland Laddie and Butcher, Baker, Candlestickmaker, with the three series each later being compiled as volumes of The Boys.\nAfter The Boys was completed, Ennis told CBR.com that the comic had benefitted from Wildstorm cancelling it, in that Dynamite gave him far more freedom than DC ever would have, saying, \"We'd have died on the vine [at DC]. The book would have been chipped and chipped away at until writing it was pure frustration.\" He also admitted to \"a sigh of relief\" as Wildstorm had been dissolved as an imprint not long after the move.\nAn eight-issue epilogue series, Dear Becky, was published from June to November 2020.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe series is set between 2006 and 2008 in a world where superheroes exist, and 9/11 had marked the destruction of the Brooklyn Bridge instead of the Twin Towers. However, most of the superheroes in the series' universe are corrupted by their celebrity status and often engage in reckless behavior, compromising the safety of the world. The story follows a small clandestine CIA squad, informally known as \"The Boys\", led by Billy Butcher and comprising Mother's Milk, the Frenchman, the Female, and new addition ", "\"Wee Hughie\" Campbell, who are charged with monitoring the superhero community, often leading to gruesome confrontations and dreadful results; in parallel, a key subplot follows Annie \"Starlight\" January, a young and naive superhero who joins the Vought-American-sanctioned superhero team called The Seven, the most prestigious\u2014and corrupt\u2014superhero group in the world and The Boys' most powerful enemies.\n\n\n== Characters ==\n\n\n== Collected editions ==\nDynamite releases both hardcover and trade paperback collections on an ongoing basis (including those comics previously published by Wildstorm). In addition, Dynamite also releases \"Definitive\" slipcased hardcovers, which contain two trade/hardcover collections to an \"omnibus.\"\n\n\n=== Definitive Editions ===\n\n\n=== Oversized Hardcover Omnibus ===\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2008: Nominated, \"Best Continuing Series\", Eisner Award.\n2009: Nominated, \"Comic Book of the Year Under $3.00\", Diamond Comic Distributor Gem Awards.\n2010: Nominated, \"Best Comic Book or Graphic Novel\", Scream Awards.\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\n\n=== Scrapped film ===\nVariety reported in February 2008 that Columbia Pictures had optioned the comic for a film adaptation, to be produced by Neal H. Moritz. and Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi writing the screenplay. In August 2010, Adam McKay said that he had been signed on to direct the film. McKay added, \"They already have a script and we're doing a rewrite on it so hopefully getting the whole thing into shape in the Fall with maybe a shoot happening in January.\" Columbia Pictures reported in February 2012 that it had dropped its option regarding a film adaptation of The Boys. However, Adam McKay said in a Twitter response that Paramount Pictures had picked it up, and that it was still in the works. On April 30, 2013, Manfredi and Hay were hired by Paramount to write the film, though the project never came to fruition.\n\n\n=== Television series ===\n\nIn October 2015, it was reported that Cinemax greenlit a television series adaptation ", "of The Boys, and that Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg and Eric Kripke were producing the series. In September 2017, Variety reported that Amazon Studios had picked up the series. The series premiered its first season on July 26, 2019. The second season premiered on September 4, 2020, while the third season premiered on June 3, 2022, and the fourth season premiered on June 13, 2024. In May 2024, the series was renewed for a fifth and final season.\n\n\n=== Audiobook series ===\nAll 98 issues of the comic series have been adapted into 7 audiobooks produced with a full cast of actors, immersive sound effects and cinematic music by GraphicAudio. Volume 1 was released on May 4, 2020. Volume 7 adapts the Dear Becky epilogue series and concluded the audiobook production on May 20, 2022. The entire series lasts 31 hours, retains the 2006\u20132008 setting and the dialogue is a very close match to Garth Ennis' original scripts. The content rating is Ages 18+.\n\n\n=== Animated series ===\n\nAn animated spin-off series of The Boys, The Boys Presents: Diabolical, was released on March 4, 2022.\n\n\n=== \"We Gotta Go Now\" adaptation ===\n\nA live-action spin-off series of The Boys, Gen V (formerly The Boys Presents: Varsity), serving as a stand-alone adaptation of the \"We Gotta Go Now\" arc from the comic series, focused on Marie and the G-Men and inspired by The Hunger Games, was announced on September 20, 2020, and premiered on Amazon Prime Video on September 29, 2023.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSullivan, Michael Patrick (April 19, 2007). \"The Boys\" Are Back in Town: Ennis & Robertson Speak.

Archived from the original on March 27, 2008.", "An American comic book is a thin periodical originating in the United States, on average 32 pages, containing comics. While the form originated in 1933, American comic books first gained popularity after the 1938 publication of Action Comics, which included the debut of the superhero Superman.  This was followed by a superhero boom that lasted until the end of World War II. After the war, while superheroes were marginalized, the comic book industry rapidly expanded and genres such as horror, crime, science fiction and romance became popular. The 1950s saw a gradual decline, due to a shift away from print media in the wake of television and the impact of the Comics Code Authority. The late 1950s and the 1960s saw a superhero revival and superheroes remained the dominant character archetype throughout the late 20th century into the 21st century. \nSome fans collect comic books, helping drive up their value. Some have sold for more than US$1 million. Comic shops cater to fans, selling comic books, plastic sleeves (\"bags\") and cardboard backing (\"boards\") to protect the comic books.\nAn American comic book is also known as a floppy comic. It is typically thin and stapled, unlike traditional books.\nAmerican comic books are one of the three major comic book industries globally, along with Japanese manga and the Franco-Belgian comic books.\n\n\n== Format ==\nThe typical size and page count of comics have varied over the decades, generally tending toward smaller formats and fewer pages.\nHistorically, the size was derived from folding one sheet of Quarter Imperial paper (15 in \u00d7 11 in or 380 mm \u00d7 280 mm), to print 4 pages which were each 7+1\u20442 by 11 inches (190 mm \u00d7 280 mm). This also meant that the page count had to be some multiple of 4.\nIn recent decades, standard comics have been trimmed at about 6.625 x 10.25 inches.\nThe format of the American comic book has been adapted periodically outside the United States, especially in Canada and the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Creating comics ", "==\nWhile comics can be the work of a single creator, the labor of creating them is frequently divided between a number of specialists.  There may be a separate writer and artist, or there may be separate artists for the characters and backgrounds.\nParticularly in superhero comic books, the art may be divided between:\n\na writer, who plots the story and writes the dialogue\na penciller (usually termed the artist), who, working exclusively in pencils, generally lays out the panel breakdown on the page, and draws the actual artwork in each panel (but layouts may be handled by a separate artist), and who, particularly at Marvel Comics, may also co-plot the storyline\nan inker, working exclusively in ink, who finishes the artwork ready for the printing press.\na colorist, who adds the color to the pages (but this usually involves preparing four individual separations in cyan, magenta, yellow and black for the CMYK printing process, not a literal application of those colors to the inked pages)\na letterer, who adds the captions and speech balloons (from the script prepared by the writer).\nThe process begins with the writer (often in collaboration with one or more others, who may include the editor and/or the penciller) coming up with a story idea or concept, then working it up into a plot and storyline, finalizing it with a script.  After the art is prepared, the dialogue and captions are lettered onto the page from the script, and an editor may have the final say (but, once ready for printing, it is difficult and expensive to make any major changes), before the comic is sent to the printer.\nThe creative team, the writer and artist(s), may work for a comic book publisher who handles the marketing, advertising, and other logistics. A wholesale distributor, such as Diamond Comic Distributors, the largest in the US, distributes the printed product to retailers.\nAnother aspect of the process involved in successful comics is the interaction between the readers/fans and the creator(", "s). Fan art and letters to the editor were commonly printed in the back of the book, until, in the early 21st century, various Internet forums started to replace this tradition.\n\n\n== Independent and alternative comics ==\n\nThe growth of comic specialty stores helped permit several waves of independently-produced comics, beginning in the mid-1970s. Some early examples of these \u2013 generally referred to as \"independent\" or \"alternative\" comics \u2013 such as Big Apple Comix, continued somewhat in the tradition of the earlier underground comics, while others, such as Star Reach, resembled the output of mainstream publishers in format and genre but were published by smaller artist-owned ventures or by a single artist.\nThis so-called \"small press\" scene (a term derived from the limited quantity of comics printed in each press-run) continued to grow and diversify, with a number of small publishers in the 1990s changing the format and distribution of their comic books to more closely resemble non-comics publishing. The \"minicomics\" form, an extremely informal version of self-publishing, arose in the 1980s and became increasingly popular among artists in the 1990s, despite reaching an even more limited audience than the small presses.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Proto-comic books ===\n\nThe development of the modern American comic book happened in stages. Publishers had collected comic strips in hardcover book form as early as 1842, with  The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck, a collection of English-language newspaper inserts originally published in Europe as the 1837 book Histoire de Mr. Vieux Bois by Rodolphe T\u00f6pffer.\nThe G. W. Dillingham Company published the first known proto-comic-book magazine in the US, The Yellow Kid in McFadden's Flats, in 1897. A hardcover book, it reprinted material\u2014primarily the October 18, 1896, to January 10, 1897, sequence titled \"McFadden's Row of Flats\"\u2014from cartoonist Richard F. Outcault's newspaper comic strip Hogan's Alley, starring the Yellow Kid. The 196", "-page, square-bound, black-and-white publication, which also includes introductory text by E. W. Townsend, measured 5 by 7 inches (130 mm \u00d7 180 mm) and sold for 50 cents. The neologism \"comic book\" appears on the back cover. Despite the publication of a series of related Hearst comics soon afterward, the first monthly proto-comic book, Embee Distributing Company's Comic Monthly, did not appear until 1922. Produced in an 8+1\u20442-by-9-inch (220 mm \u00d7 230 mm) format, it reprinted black-and-white newspaper comic strips and lasted a year.\n\n\n=== The Funnies and Funnies on Parade ===\n\nIn 1929, Dell Publishing (founded by George T. Delacorte, Jr.) published The Funnies, described by the Library of Congress as \"a short-lived newspaper tabloid insert\" and not to be confused with Dell's 1936 comic-book series of the same name. Historian Ron Goulart describes the 16-page, four-color periodical as \"more a Sunday comic section without the rest of the newspaper than a true comic book. But it did offer all original material and was sold on newsstands\". The Funnies ran for 36 issues, published Saturdays through October 16, 1930.\nIn 1933, salesperson Maxwell Gaines, sales manager Harry I. Wildenberg, and owner George Janosik of the Waterbury, Connecticut, company Eastern Color Printing\u2014which printed, among other things, Sunday-paper comic-strip sections \u2013 produced Funnies on Parade as a way to keep their presses running. Like The Funnies, but only eight pages, this appeared as a newsprint magazine. Rather than using original material, however, it reprinted in color several comic strips licensed from the McNaught Syndicate, the Ledger Syndicate, and the Bell-McClure Syndicate. These included such popular strips as  cartoonist Al Smith's Mutt and Jeff, Ham Fisher's Joe Palooka, and Percy Crosby's Skippy. Eastern Color neither sold this periodical nor made it available on newsstands, but rather sent it out free as a promotional item to consumers who mailed in coupons clipped from Procter &", " Gamble soap and toiletries products. The company printed 10,000 copies. The promotion proved a success, and Eastern Color that year produced similar periodicals for Canada Dry soft drinks, Kinney Shoes, Wheatena cereal and others, with print runs of from 100,000 to 250,000.\n\n\n=== Famous Funnies and New Fun ===\n\nAlso in 1933, Gaines and Wildenberg collaborated with Dell to publish the 36-page Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics, which historians consider the first true American comic book; Goulart, for example, calls it \"the cornerstone for one of the most lucrative branches of magazine publishing\". Distribution took place through the Woolworth's department-store chain, though it remains unclear whether it was sold or given away; the cover displays no price, but Goulart refers, either metaphorically or literally, to \"sticking a ten-cent pricetag  [sic] on the comic books\".\nWhen Delacorte declined to continue with Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics, Eastern Color on its own published Famous Funnies #1 (cover-dated July 1934), a 68-page giant selling for 10\u00a2. Distributed to newsstands by the mammoth American News Company, it proved a hit with readers during the cash-strapped Great Depression, selling 90 percent of its 200,000 print, although putting Eastern Color more than $4,000 in the red. That quickly changed, with the book turning a $30,000 profit each issue starting with #12.  Famous Funnies would eventually run 218 issues, inspire imitators, and largely launch a new mass medium.\nWhen the supply of available existing comic strips began to dwindle, early comic books began to include a small amount of new, original material in comic-strip format. Inevitably, a comic book of all-original material, with no comic-strip reprints, debuted. Fledgling publisher Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson founded National Allied Publications, which would evolve into DC Comics, to release New Fun #1 (Feb. 1935). This came out as a tabloid-sized, 10-by-15-inch (250 mm \u00d7 380 mm), 36-page ma", "gazine with a card-stock, non-glossy cover. An anthology, it mixed humor features such as the funny animal comic \"Pelion and Ossa\" and the college-set \"Jigger and Ginger\" with such dramatic fare as the Western strip \"Jack Woods\" and the \"yellow-peril\" adventure \"Barry O'Neill\", featuring a Fu Manchu-styled villain, Fang Gow. Issue #6 (Oct. 1935) brought the comic-book debut of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, the future creators of Superman. The two began their careers with the musketeer swashbuckler \"Henri Duval\", doing the first two installments before turning it over to others and, under the pseudonyms \"Leger and Reuths\", they created the supernatural-crimefighter adventure Doctor Occult.\n\n\n=== Superheroes and the Golden Age ===\n\nIn 1938, after Wheeler-Nicholson's partner Harry Donenfeld had ousted him, National Allied editor Vin Sullivan pulled a Siegel/Shuster creation from the slush pile and used it as the cover feature (but only as a backup story) in Action Comics #1 (June 1938). The duo's alien hero, Superman, was dressed in a cape and colorful tights. The costume, influenced by Flash Gordon's attire from 1934, evoked circus aerial performers and circus strongmen, and Superman became the archetype of the \"superheroes\" that would follow.\nIn early 1939, the success of Superman in Action Comics prompted editors at National Comics Publications (the future DC Comics) to request more superheroes for its titles. In response, Bob Kane and Bill Finger created Batman, who debuted in Detective Comics #27 (May 1939). The period from the late 1930s through roughly the end of the 1940s is referred to by comic book experts as the Golden Age of comic books. It featured extremely large print-runs, with Action Comics and Captain Marvel selling over half a million copies a month each; comics provided very popular cheap entertainment during World War II especially among soldiers, but with erratic quality in stories, art, and printing. In the early 1940s, over 90 percent of girls a", "nd boys from seven to seventeen read comic books.\nIn 1941, H. G. Peter and William Moulton Marston, created the female superhero character Wonder Woman, who debuted in All Star Comics #8 (December 1941) and Sensation Comics featuring Wonder Woman in 1942.\nMLJ's Pep Comics debuted as a superhero, science-fiction and adventure anthology, but after the title introduced the teen-humor feature \"Archie\" in 1942, the feature's popularity would soon eclipse all other MLJ properties, leading the publisher to rename itself Archie Comics.\nFollowing the end of World War II, the popularity of superheroes greatly diminished, while the comic-book industry itself expanded. A few well-established characters such as Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman continued to sell, but DC canceled series starring the Flash and Green Lantern and converted All-American Comics and All Star Comics to Western titles, and Star Spangled Comics to a war title. The publisher also launched such science-fiction titles as Strange Adventures and Mystery in Space. Martin Goodman's Timely Comics, also known as Atlas, canceled its three formerly high-selling superhero titles starring Captain America (created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby), the Human Torch, and the Sub-Mariner, briefly reviving the characters in 1954 only to cancel them again shortly thereafter to focus on horror, science fiction, teen humor, romance and Western genres. Romance comics became strongly established, with Prize Comics' Young Romance and with Young Love, the latter written and drawn by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby; those two titles' popularity led to an explosion of romance comics from many publishers.\nDell's comic books accounted for a third of all North American sales in the early 1950s. Its 90 titles averaged a circulation of 800,000 copies per title for every issue, with Walt Disney's Comics and Stories peaking at a circulation of three million a month in 1953.  Eleven of the top 25 bestselling comic books at the time were Dell titles.  ", "Out of 40 publishers active in 1954, Dell, Atlas (i.e. Marvel), DC, and Archie were the major players in volume of sales. By this point, former big-time players Fawcett and Fiction House had ceased publishing.\nCirculation peaked in 1952 when 3,161 issues of various comics were published with a total circulation of about one billion copies.  After 1952, the number of individual releases dropped every year for the rest of the decade, with the biggest falls occurring in 1955\u201356.  The rapid decline followed the introduction of the Comics Code Authority in the wake of Senate hearings on juvenile delinquency, which, ignoring the social problems caused by the wars of 1939\u201345 and 1950\u201352, sought to blame those problems solely on comics.  While there was only a 9% drop in the number of releases between 1952 and 1953, circulation plummeted by an estimated 30\u201340%. The cause of the decrease is not entirely clear. Television had begun to provide competition with comic books, but there was also a rise in conservative values with the election in 1952 of Dwight Eisenhower. The Comics Code Authority, a self-censoring body founded to curb the juvenile delinquency alleged to be due to the crime and horror comics, has often been targeted as the culprit, but sales had begun to drop the year before it was founded. The major publishers were not seriously harmed by the drop in sales, but smaller publishers were killed off: EC (the prime target of the CCA) stopped publishing crime and horror titles, which was their entire business, and were forced out of the market altogether, turning to magazine publishing instead. By 1960, output had stabilized at about 1,500 releases per year (representing a greater than fifty percent decline since 1952).\nThe dominant comic book genres of the post-CCA 1950s were funny animals, humor, romance, television properties, and Westerns. Detective, fantasy, teen, and war comics were also popular, but adventure, superheroes, and comic strip reprints were in declin", "e, with Famous Funnies seeing its last issue in 1955.\n\n\n=== The Comics Code ===\n\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s horror and true-crime comics flourished, many containing graphic violence and gore.  Due to such content, moral crusaders became concerned with the impact of comics on the youth, and were blaming comic books for everything from poor grades to juvenile delinquency to drug abuse. This perceived indecency resulted in the collection and public burning of comic books in Spencer, West Virginia and Binghamton, New York in 1948, which received national attention and triggered other public burnings by schools and parent groups across the country. Some cities passed laws banning comic books entirely. In 1954, psychiatrist Fredric Wertham published his book Seduction of the Innocent, where he discussed what he perceived as sadistic and homosexual undertones in horror comics and superhero comics respectively, and singled out EC Comics due to its success as a publisher of these genres. In response to growing public anxiety, the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency held hearings on comic book indecency from April to June 1954. \nIn the wake of these troubles, a group of comics publishers, led by National and Archie, founded the Comics Code Authority in 1954 and drafted the Comics Code, intended as \"the most stringent code in existence for any communications media\". A Comic Code Seal of Approval soon appeared on virtually every comic book carried on newsstands. EC, after experimenting with less controversial comic books, dropped its comics line to focus on the satirical Mad\u2014a former comic book which was now converted to a magazine format in order to circumvent the Code.\n\n\n=== Silver Age of Comic Books ===\n\nDC started a revival in superhero comics in 1956 with the October 1956 revival of its former golden age top-seller The Flash in Showcase #4.  Many comics historians peg this as the beginning of the Silver Age of American comic books, although Marvel (at this p", "oint still known variously as both Timely and Atlas) had started reviving some of its old superheroes as early as 1954. The new Flash is taken symbolically as the beginning of a new era, although his success was not immediate. It took two years for the Flash to receive his own title, and Showcase itself was only a bimonthly book, though one which was to introduce a large number of enduring characters.  By 1959, the slowly building superhero revival had become clear to DC's competitors. Archie jumped on board that year, and Charlton joined the bandwagon in 1960.\nIn 1961, at the demand of publisher Martin Goodman (who was reacting to a surge in sales of National's newest superhero title The Justice League of America), writer/editor Stan Lee and artist/co-plotter Jack Kirby created the Fantastic Four for Atlas, which now re-named itself Marvel Comics. With an innovation that changed the comic-book industry, Fantastic Four #1 initiated a  naturalistic  style of superheroes with human failings, fears, and inner demons - heroes who squabbled and worried about the likes of paying the rent. In contrast to the super-heroic do-gooder archetypes of established superheroes at the time, this ushered in a revolution. With dynamic artwork by Kirby, Steve Ditko, Don Heck, and others, complementing Lee's colorful, catchy prose, the new style became very popular among teenagers and college students who could identify with the angsty and irreverent nature of characters like Spider-Man, Hulk, X-Men and Fantastic Four. This was a time of social upheaval, giving birth to a new generation of hip and more counter-cultural youngsters, who found a voice in these books. Because Marvel's books were distributed by its rival, National, from 1957 until 1968 Marvel were restricted to publishing only eight titles a month. This was a cloud with a silver lining, and proved the making of Marvel, allowing the company to concentrate its brightest and best talent on a small number of titles, at a time wh", "en its rivals were spreading their creative talents very thin across a huge number of monthly titles. The quality of Marvel's product soared in consequence, and sales soared with it.\n\nWhile the creators of comics were given credit in the early days of comic books, this practice had all but vanished during the 1940s and 1950s. Comic books were produced by comic book companies rather than by individual creators (EC being a notable exception, a company that not only credited its creative teams but also featured creators' biographies). Even comic books by revered and collectible artists like Carl Barks were not known by their creator's name\u2014Disney comics by Barks were signed \"Walt Disney\". In the 1960s, DC, and then Marvel, began to include writer and artist credits on the comics that they published.\nOther notable companies publishing comics during the Silver Age included the American Comics Group (ACG), Charlton, Dell, Gold Key, Harvey Comics, and Tower.\n\n\n=== Underground comix ===\n\nSex, drugs and rock 'n' roll were featured, as the anti-authoritarian underground comix made waves in 1968, following the publication of Robert Crumb's irregularly published Zap Comix. Frank Stack had published The Adventures of Jesus as far back as 1962, and there had been a trickle of such publications until Crumb's success. What had started as a self-publishing scene soon grew into a minor industry, with Print Mint, Kitchen Sink, Last Gasp and Apex Novelties among the more well-known publishers. These comix were often extremely graphic, and largely distributed in head shops that flourished in the countercultural era.\nLegal issues and paper shortages led to a decline in underground comix output from its 1972 peak. In 1974 the passage of anti-paraphernalia laws in the US led to the closing of most head shops, which throttled underground comix distribution. Its readership also dried up as the hippie movement itself petered out in the mid-1970s.\n\n\n=== Bronze Age of Comic Books ===\n\nWizard or", "iginally used the phrase \"Bronze Age\", in 1995, to denote the Modern Horror age. But as of 2009 historians and fans use \"Bronze Age\" to describe the period of American mainstream comics history that began with the period of concentrated changes to comic books in 1970. Unlike the Golden/Silver Age transition, the Silver/Bronze transition involves many continuing books, making the transition less sharp.\n\n\n=== The Modern Age ===\n\nThe development of the \"direct market\" distribution system in the 1970s coincided with the appearance of comic-book specialty stores across North America. These specialty stores were a haven for more distinct voices and stories, but they also marginalized comics in the public eye. Serialized comic stories became longer and more complex, requiring readers to buy more issues to finish a story.\nIn the mid-to-late 1980s, two series published by DC Comics, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns and Watchmen, had a profound impact upon the American comic-book industry. Their popularity, along with mainstream media attention and critical acclaim, combined with changing social tastes, led to a considerably darker tone in comic books during the 1990s nicknamed by fans as the \"grim-and-gritty\" era.\nThe growing popularity of antiheroes such as  Wolverine and the Punisher exemplified this change, as did the darker tone of some independent publishers such as First Comics, Dark Horse Comics, and (founded in the 1990s) Image Comics. This tendency towards darkness and nihilism was manifested in DC's production of heavily promoted comic book stories such as \"A Death in the Family\" in the Batman series (in which The Joker brutally murdered Batman's sidekick Robin), while at Marvel the continuing popularity of the various X-Men books led to storylines involving the genocide of superpowered \"mutants\" in allegorical stories about religious and ethnic persecution.\nIn addition, published formats like the graphic novel and the related trade paperback enabled the comic book ", "to gain some respectability as literature. As a result, these formats are now common in book retail and the collections of US public libraries.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCartoon\nComic book archive\nComic book therapy\nComics studies\nComics vocabulary\nCreator ownership\nDigital comics\nHistory of American comics\nList of comic book publishing companies\nList of films based on English-language comics\nList of years in comics\nSexism in American comics\nTijuana bible\nAdvertising in comic books\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAll in Color for a Dime by Dick Lupoff & Don Thompson ISBN 0-87341-498-5\nThe Comic Book Makers by Joe Simon with Jim Simon ISBN 1-887591-35-4\nDC Comics: Sixty Years of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes by Les Daniels ISBN 0-8212-2076-4\nThe Great Comic Book Heroes by Jules Feiffer ISBN 1-56097-501-6\nMarvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics by Les Daniels ISBN 0-8109-3821-9\nMasters of Imagination: The Comic Book Artists Hall of Fame by Mike Benton ISBN 0-87833-859-4\nThe Official Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide by Robert Overstreet\u2014Edition #35 ISBN 0-375-72107-X\nThe Steranko History of Comics, Vol. 1 & 2, by James Steranko\u2014Vol. 1 ISBN 0-517-50188-0\nGarrett, Greg, Holy Superheroes!

Commonly, comic conventions are multi-day events hosted at convention centers, hotels, or college campuses. They feature a wide variety of activities and panels, with a larger number of attendees participating with cosplay than for most other types of fan conventions. Comic book conventions are also used as a method by which publishers, distributors, and retailers represent their comic-related releases. Comic book conventions may be considered derivatives of science-fiction conventions, which began during the late 1930s.\nComic-cons were traditionally organized by fans on a not-for-profit basis, though nowadays most events catering to fans are managed by commercial interests for profit. Many conventions have award presentations relating to comics (such as the Eisner Awards, which have been presented at San Diego Comic-Con since 1988; or the Harvey Awards, which have been presented at a variety of venues also since 1988).\nAt commercial events, comic book creators often sign autographs for the fans, sometimes in exchange for a fixed appearance fee, and may sometimes draw illustrations for a per-item fee. Commercial conventions are usually quite expensive and are hosted in hotels. This represents a change for comic book conventions, which were traditionally more oriented toward comic books as a mode of literature, and maintained less differentiation between professional and fan.\nThe first official comic book convention was held in 1964 in New York City and was named New York Comicon. Early conventions were small affairs, usually organized by local enthusiasts (such as Jerry Bails, known later as the \"Father of Comic Fandom\", and Dave Kaler of the Academy of Comic-Book Fans and Collectors), and featuring a few industry guests. The first recurring conventions were the Detroit Triple Fan Fair, wh", "ich ran from 1965 to 1978, and Academy Con, which ran from 1965 to 1967. Many recurring conventions begin as single-day events in small venues, which as they grow more popular expand to two days, or even three or more every year. Many comic-cons which had their start in church basements or union halls now fill convention centers in major cities.\nNowadays, comic conventions are big business, with recurring shows in every major American city. Comic book conventions in name only, the biggest shows include a large range of popular culture and entertainment elements of virtually all genres, including horror, animation, anime, manga, toys, collectible card games, video games, webcomics, and fantasy novels.\nSan Diego Comic-Con, a multigenre entertainment and comic convention held annually in San Diego since 1970, is the best known of U.S. comic-cons. According to Forbes, the convention is the \"largest convention of its kind in the world\"; and is also the largest convention held in San Diego. According to the San Diego Convention and Visitor's Bureau, the convention has an annual regional economic effect of $162.8 million, with a $180 million economic impact in 2011.  However, in 2017, SDCC lost its record of the largest annual multigenre convention to S\u00e3o Paulo's Comic Con Experience (first held in 2014).\nInternationally, the world's largest comic book convention, in terms of attendees, is Japan's Comiket (first held in 1975), which boasts an annual attendance of more than half a million people. Italy's Lucca Comics & Games (first held in 1965) and France's Angoul\u00eame International Comics Festival (first staged in 1974) are the world's second and third largest comic festivals, respectively.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nIn 1961 or 1962, Jerry Bails was vital for the formation of the Academy of Comic-Book Fans and Collectors (ACBFC), the first official organization of comic book enthusiasts and historians. The ACBFC brought fans of the medium together, administered the f", "irst industry awards, and assisted with the establishment of the first comic book conventions.\nThe academy's first order of business was to administer the Alley Awards, which traced their origin to \"a letter to Jerry dated October 25, 1961\", by fellow enthusiast (and future comics professional) Roy Thomas, in which he suggested to Bails that his fanzine Alter-Ego create its own awards to reward fandom's \"favorite comic books in a number of categories\" in a manner similar to the Oscars. The first Alley Awards, given for the calendar year 1961, were reported in Alter Ego No. 4 (Oct. 1962).\n\n\n=== Alley Talley and other gatherings of 1964 ===\nOn March 21\u201322, 1964, the first annual \"Alley Tally\" by ACBFC members was organized by Bails at his house in Detroit, with the purpose of counting \"the Alley Award ballots for 1963\". This became notable in retrospect as the first major gathering of comics fans, predating the earliest comic book conventions, which were held later in the year. Attendees included Ronn Foss, Don Glut, Don and Maggie Thompson, Mike Vosburg, and Grass Green. Comics historian Bill Schelly notes that the Alley Tally and \"even larger fan meetings in Chicago ... helped build momentum\" for these earliest conventions. (The Chicago gathering occurred May 9\u201310, 1964; it featured \"several dozen\" attendees, a dealer room, and film showings.)\nIn addition, an unnamed convention held May 24, 1964, in the Hotel Tuller, Detroit, Michigan, was organized by teenagers Robert Brusch and Dave Szurek, with assistance from Bails and members of the Michigan Science Fiction Society. This gathering featured about 80 fans of the comic book medium.\n\n\n=== New York Comicon ===\nThe first recorded \"official\" comic book convention occurred in 1964 in New York City. Known as the \"New York Comicon\", it was held July 24, 1964, at the Workman's Circle Building. A one-day convention organized by 16-year-old Bernie Bubnis and fellow enthusiast Ron Fradkin, official guests of the Tri-State Co", "n included Steve Ditko, Flo Steinberg, and Tom Gill. Reports were of over 100 attendees.\n\n\n=== 1965: The first recurring conventions ===\nContinuing the momentum from the previous year, Bails, Shel Dorf, and the members of the Michigan Science Fiction Society formed the \"organizing committee\" of the multigenre convention Detroit Triple Fan Fair (DTFF), which was held July 24\u201325, 1965 at the Embassy Hotel, in Detroit, Michigan. The DTTF was held annually in Detroit until 1978.\nMeanwhile, in New York City, teacher/comics enthusiast Dave Kaler had taken over as ACBFC Executive Secretary; the organization produced Academy Con I (officially known as \"Comi Con: Second Annual Convention of Academy of Comic-Book Fans and Collectors\"), held July 31 \u2013 August 1, 1965, at the Broadway Central Hotel. With Kaler's management, the academy produced three successful \"Academy Con\" shows in New York during the summers of 1965\u20131967, attracting industry professionals such as Otto Binder, Bill Finger, Gardner Fox, Mort Weisinger, James Warren, Roy Thomas, Gil Kane, Stan Lee, Bill Everett, Carmine Infantino, and Julius Schwartz. As befitting a convention run by the Academy of Comic-Book Fans and Collectors, the Alley Awards were presented at all three Academy Cons. The 1965 Academy Con also featured one of the first recorded \"superhero masquerades\", or costume contests.\n1965 also saw the genesis of what became the annual Italian comic book convention Lucca Comics & Games. Rinaldo Traini and Romano Calisi (forming the International Congress of Cartoonists and Animators) held the Salone Internazionale del Comics (\"International Congress of Comics\") in Bordighera. In 1966, it was relocated to a small piazza in the center of Lucca, and has grown in size and importance over the years.\n\n\n=== Expansion and growth ===\nIn 1966, comic book conventions continued to evolve and expand, The July 23\u201324 New York Comicon (not to be confused with the later New York Comic Con) was held at the Park Sheraton H", "otel, in New York. Produced by John Benson, guests included Jack Kirby, Jim Steranko, Otto Binder, Len Brown, Larry Ivie, Jack Binder, Roy Thomas, Gil Kane, Archie Goodwin, Bhob Stewart, Klaus Nordling, Sal Trapani, Rocke Mastroserio, and Ted White. (There were four women in attendance: Pat Lupoff, Lee Hoffman, Flo Steinberg, and Maggie Thompson.) Featured events included a keynote speech by Kirby, a discussion about censorship between Don Thompson and Comics Code Authority acting administrator Leonard Darvin, a panel about the Golden Age of Comics, and one on the \"so-called 'Forgotten '50s\", particularly EC Comics. Bhob Stewart, on a panel with Archie Goodwin and Ted White, predicted that there would soon be \"underground comics\" just as there were already \"underground films\".\nThat same summer (August 12\u201314) in New York, Dave Kaler produced Academy Con II at the City Squire Inn.\nMeanwhile, also in 1966, the first Southwesterncon was held in Dallas, Texas. Organized by Larry Herndon (of the fanzine Star Studded Comics), the official guest was Dave Kaler; about 70 attendees participated. Later Southwesterncons rotated between Houston (\"Houstoncon\") and Dallas (\"D-Con\"), adding Oklahoma City (\"Multicon\") to the mix in 1970. The Southwesterncon partnership lasted roughly until 1971, with Houstoncon, D-Con, and Multicon continuing separately until 1982.\nIn 1966, a new convention, Gateway Con, was inaugurated in St. Louis.\nIn 1968, two important conventions had their start. Taking over for the Academy Con, Brooklyn native and school teacher Phil Seuling hosted the International Convention of Comic Book Art at the Statler Hilton Hotel in New York City on July 4\u20137. The guests of honor were Stan Lee and Burne Hogarth This annual convention, which later became known as the Comic Art Convention (CAC), hosted the presentation of the Alley Awards from 1968 to 1970. CAC ran annually (occasionally in Philadelphia) over Independence Day weekend, until 1983. In England, Phil Clarke ", "produced Comicon '68 (British Comic Art Convention) at the Midland Hotel, Birmingham, from August 30 to September 2, 1968. \"Member\"-guests include Alan Moore, Paul Neary, Jim Baikie, Steve Moore, and Nick Landau; there were 70 attendees. The British Comicon ran annually, variously in Birmingham, London, and Sheffield, until 1981.\n\n\n=== The 1970s and explosive growth ===\nComic book conventions increased dramatically during the 1970s, with many of the largest conventions of the modern era being established during the decade. During the early 1970s, conventions were initiated in almost every major American city (and some minor ones), as well as in London, with Comic Mart, a bimonthly trade show which ran regularly until the mid-1980s. Comic book creators, editors, and publishers began to make it part of their routine to attend conventions as official guests. Major comics-related news events were often revealed at annual conventions: examples include the news that Jack Kirby was defecting from Marvel to DC, and DC's announcement that it was reviving Captain Marvel.\nOn August 1\u20133, 1970, Shel Dorf produced the Golden State Comic-Con, held at the U.S. Grant Hotel, in San Diego. Official guests were Forrest J. Ackerman, Ray Bradbury, Jack Kirby, Bob Stevens, and A. E. van Vogt, and it drew 300 people. The three-day show evolved into San Diego Comic-Con, and now attracts 130,000 or more attendees.\nThe Creation Convention debuted in 1971, organized by 14-year-old Queens schoolboys Adam Malin and Gary Berman, and held over Thanksgiving weekend at the New Yorker Hotel, in New York City. The guest of honor was Jim Steranko. From that time until the late 1980s, Creation Entertainment continued producing large annual conventions in New York City, usually occurring the weekend after Thanksgiving. A popular venue for the Thanksgiving cons was the Statler Hilton Hotel. In the mid-1970s, attendance at the New York Creation conventions averaged around 5,000 fans; the admission was arou", "nd $5/day.\nThe 1971 Comic Art Convention (held July 2\u20134 at the Statler Hilton Hotel, New York City) was notable for being the convention credited by Will Eisner for his return to comics:\n\nI came back into the field because of [convention organizer Phil Seuling]. I remember [him] calling me in New London, [Connecticut], where I was sitting there as chairman of the board of Croft Publishing Co. My secretary said, 'There's a Mr. Seuling on the phone and he's talking about a comics convention. What is that?' She said, 'I didn't know you were a cartoonist, Mr. Eisner.' 'Oh, yes,' I said, 'secretly; I'm a closet cartoonist.' I came down and was stunned at the existence of the whole world. ... That was a world that I had left, and I found it very exciting, very stimulating\".\nNostalgia '72, held July 22\u201323, 1972, at the Pick-Congress Hotel, was the first Chicago-area comics and collectibles convention. Produced by Nancy Warner, the show had about 2,000 attendees. That show evolved into the Chicago Comicon (now known as Fan Expo Chicago), and has been known to attract as many as 70,000 attendees annually.\nThe Angoul\u00eame International Comics Festival debuted in Angoul\u00eame, France, in January 1974. 10,000 attendees made it the most successful inaugural comic book festival to that date. 1974 also saw the first OrlandoCon, organized by regional chairman of the National Cartoonists Society Jim Ivey; guests included C. C. Beck, Roy Crane, Hal Foster, Ron Goulart, and Les Turner. OrlandoCon ran annually for 20+ years until 1994.\nIn 1976, there were 20 comic book conventions held throughout the United States; many of them attracted thousands of attendees. About this time specialized shows began being organized, emphasizing on such topics as so-called \"underground comics\", EC Comics, women in comics, and individual creators like Frank Frazetta.\nIn August 1979, FantaCo Enterprises publisher Thomas Skulan produced FantaCon '80 at The Egg convention center, Empire State Plaza, in Albany, ", "New York. The first annual Albany-area horror and comic book convention, FantaCon ran annually until 1990.\n\n\n=== Creation Entertainment spreads its wings ===\nBeginning about 1980, Creation Entertainment expanded its conventions beyond New York, producing cons in San Francisco and Washington, D.C. By 1983, the company was the main producer of comic book conventions nationwide. For instance, in 1986, Creation produced large-scale comics conventions in at least six cities, including Philadelphia, Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and New Brunswick, New Jersey. (The New York show featured a special tribute to Marvel Comics' 25th anniversary; guests included Stan Lee and Jim Shooter.)\nDuring this time, Creation branched out from comics and began producing conventions for the genres of horror and science fiction; it was known particularly for its Doctor Who conventions. After 1988, the company stopped producing comic book conventions to emphasize its other, more profitable, fan conventions.\n\n\n=== The 1980s ===\nBoth the Heroes Convention and the multigenre Dallas Fantasy Fair debuted in 1982. HeroesCon is one of the largest independent comic book conventions still operating; during the heyday of the Dallas Fantasy Fair, it was one of the largest comics conventions in the country, third in attendance behind the San Diego Comic-Con and the Chicago Comicon. (The Dallas Fantasy Fair went defunct in 1995.)\nComic book conventions spread to Canada and Switzerland in 1985; also debuting that year was the United Kingdom Comic Art Convention (UKCAC), first held September 21\u201322, 1985, at the University of London Union. Guests included such U.K. stars as Steve Bissette, Bill Sienkiewicz, Dave Sim, Marv Wolfman, Brian Bolland, John Bolton, Eddie Campbell, Alan Davis, Hunt Emerson, Brett Ewins, Dave Gibbons, Ian Gibson, Denis Gifford, Alan Grant, Garry Leach, David Lloyd, Mike McMahon, Alan Moore, Steve Moore, Paul Neary, Kevin O'Neill, Ron Smith, Dez Skinn, B", "ryan Talbot, and John Wagner. Admission was \u00a37.50 for both days. UKCAC ran annually until 1998.\nA number of still-extant conventions debuted in 1987, beginning with the Wonderful World of Comics Convention, held at the Oakland Convention Center, in Oakland, California. Later to be known as WonderCon, the convention was founded by San Jose native John Barrett, co-owner of the retail chain Comics and Comix. The multigenre Dragon*Con also debuted that year, hosted by the Pierremont Plaza Hotel, in Atlanta, Georgia. Official guests were Michael Moorcock (his first convention appearance in twelve years), Robert Asprin, Lynn Abbey, Robert Adams, Richard \"Lord British\" Garriott, Gary Gygax, and Toastmaster Brad Strickland; and there were 1,400 attendees.\nIn 1988, in commemoration of Superman's 50th anniversary, the Cleveland Convention Center hosted the International Superman Expo. Held June 16\u201319, official guests include Curt Swan, Jerry Ordway, George P\u00e9rez, Marv Wolfman, and Julius Schwartz.\nBy the end of the 1980s, comic book conventions were evolving into sprawling affairs that promoted movies, television shows, celebrity performers, video games, toys, and cosplay as much as (if not more than) comic books. Many historians date this shift to the release of Tim Burton's movie Batman in 1989, which began the convention circuit's newfound enthusiasm for movies.\n\n\n=== Great Eastern fills a gap ===\nGreat Eastern Conventions produced comic book conventions for almost 20 years, but most actively during the years 1987\u20131996. In New York City, the Great Eastern shows filled the gap after the mid-1980s demise of the annual Comic Art Convention and Creation Conventions. From 1993 to 1995, Great Eastern hosted two New York City shows annually at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. (The 1995 show was the last comic book convention held at the Javits Center until the New York Comic Con in 2006.) Great Eastern also ran shows in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Oregon, Minne", "sota, Texas, and South Florida. Despite their large fan attendance and expansive venues, however, Great Eastern's large shows were criticized by many within the industry for pandering to dealers and spectacle. As frequent participant Evan Dorkin stated, \"The New York shows are extremely unfriendly to both creators and fans. ... There is limited programming, limited professional appearances at these shows.\"\nIn March 1996, Great Eastern, at a very late time, cancelled what had been advertised as a larger-than-usual New York show, scheduled to be held at the New York Coliseum on 59th St. & Columbus Circle. As a substitute event, comic book retailer Michael Carbonaro and others quickly organized the first Big Apple Comic Con, now a long-running show. Greenberg and Great Eastern Conventions disappeared from the fan convention circuit from that time.\n\n\n=== Small press conventions and comic book \"festivals\" ===\nIn response to the big conventions' shifting of emphasis away from comic books themselves, a number of small conventions were organized during the mid-1990s that emphasized comics, particularly those not published by the big mainstream companies DC Comics and Marvel Comics. Many of these \"indy cons\" were inspired by Cerebus creator Dave Sim. In 1992, Sim partnered with Great Eastern Conventions in promoting small conventions in more than 20 U.S. locations, including Indiana, Oregon, Texas, as well as in South Florida. And in 1995, Sim toured the country in a self-styled nine-stop \"Spirits of Independence\" tour.\nThe antecedent to these new \"comic festivals\" may have been Berkeleycon 73, held April 20\u201322, 1973, at the Pauley Ballroom, ASUC Building, University of California, Berkeley. Berkeleycon was the first convention devoted to underground comix (which had their unofficial mecca in the San Francisco Bay Area).\nThe first exclusively small press conventions were CAPTION, which debuted in Oxford, England, in 1992; the Alternative Press Expo (APE), which debuted in Sa", "n Jose, California, in 1994; and the Small Press Expo (SPX), which premiered in Bethesda, Maryland in 1994.\n\n\n=== Wizard dominates the 2010s; con wars ===\nWizard Entertainment purchased the Chicago Comicon in 1997 to expand from its core publishing business into trade/consumer conventions. The renamed \"Wizard World Chicago\" was the template for a new kind of convention that shifted its emphasis from actual comic books to ancillary elements of popular culture fandom: celebrity performers, movies, television, video games, and toys \u2013 \"comic conventions\" almost in name only. By 2006, Wizard World Chicago boasted a weekend attendance of more than 58,000 people. \nIn 2002, Wizard produced \"Wizard World East\" in Philadelphia, a still-ongoing show (now known as \"FanExpo Philadelphia\"). The company added ongoing shows in Texas in 2003, Los Angeles in 2004, and Boston in 2005. In 2007\u20132008, Wizard held conventions in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Texas.\nBeginning in 2009, Wizard made a concerted push to dominate the North American convention circuit. The company began by starting new shows in various cities, and then by acquiring existing conventions, such as New York City's longest-running multigenre popular culture convention, the Big Apple Convention, and the Paradise Comics Toronto Comicon.\nWizard's 2010 \"North American Comic Con\" tour included shows in Toronto, Anaheim, Philadelphia, Chicago, New York City, Austin, and Boston. As part of a \"major offensive against Reed Exhibitions' New York Comic Con,\" Wizard scheduled \"three East Coast shows in a row \u2014 the New England Comic-Con in Boston on October 1-3, Big Apple the same weekend, and the new New Jersey Comic-Con the weekend after, on October 15-17.\" This was the beginning of what came to be known as the \"Con Wars\": in fact, Wizard originally scheduled the 2010 Big Apple Comic Con for October 7\u201310, the exact same dates as the previously scheduled 2010 New York Comic Con. After a public outcry, Wizard moved the ", "dates of its 2010 New York convention to October 1\u20133. (Ultimately, the \"Wizard World New York Experience\" conventions were not successful; the company omitted New York entirely in 2012 and gave up the New York market after 2013.)\nIn 2013, Wizard produced conventions in 13 cities, expanding to 20 in 2014.\nThis increase of Wizard-produced conventions resulted in accusations that the entertainment behemoth was deliberately trying to cause its competitors to fail. However, many praised Wizard's professional and standardized method of producing conventions.\nIn 2015, however, Wizard lost $4.25 million in revenue and cut back from 25 to 19 convention events in 2016. By 2018, the company was producing thirteen annual conventions around the U.S.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic harmed the convention business worldwide. Most 2020 conventions scheduled for after mid-March of that year were canceled, and many were displayed online only in 2021. Wizard World had only six in-person conventions in 2021, and that August the company announced it would be selling the convention events business to FanExpo, with the final Wizard World Chicago show occurring in October.\n\n\n=== Conventions as big business ===\nStarting during the mid-2000s, ongoing comic book conventions were organized in most major U.S. cities, most of which are still ongoing. [See List of comic book conventions] These pop-cultural gatherings attract tens of thousands of fans and generate millions of dollars in revenue every year. In addition to the Wizard-run conventions, Comic-Con International runs San Diego Comic-Con, WonderCon, and formerly ran the Alternative Press Expo; while Reed Exhibitions runs the New York Comic Con and the Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo.\n\n\n== Types ==\nSince the first conventions during the mid-1960s, hundreds of local and regional comic book conventions have been organized around the world either as one-time or annual events. At these conventions, fans of comic books come together with the profession", "al writers, artists, editors, and publishers of the business to discuss its many aspects. Increasingly, comic conventions have expanded in scope to encompass the gamut of popular culture phenomena relating to comics, from movies, television, and animation to gaming and collectibles. Some cities have a number of comic-cons. Nearly every weekend of the year now has at least one convention somewhere, and some conventions are held on holiday weekends where four or more days can be devoted to events.\n\n\n=== Commercial shows vs. volunteer conventions ===\nAn important distinction can be made between commercial events (often called \"shows\") \u2013 those managed by dedicated companies who specialize in convention organization, or by local for-profit businesses \u2013 and volunteer-run conventions.\nUsually run for profit, commercial events tend to charge for \"tickets\" or \"admission\" rather than having \"memberships\". A primary emphasis of commercial events is meeting celebrities, such as actors of television shows and movies, professional wrestlers, glamour models, etc. There are frequently very long lines of people waiting for autographs at commercial events. While famous actors like William Shatner of Star Trek are paid tens of thousands of dollars per convention, minor and obscure bit players pay to set up booths to sell autographs and memorabilia. Commercial events also tend to have less small-scale programming; panels will more often be composed of famous actors, directors, etc. on press junkets, where the panels are held in very large rooms with very high attendance. The largest conventions (in terms of attendance) tend to be commercial ones. Commercial events are more likely to be about popular visual media than volunteer cons, and they also tend to attract many younger people, but this is not absolute by any means. Some commercial conventions have been known to harass fan-run conventions via their legal teams.\nVolunteer conventions, however, tend to be smaller in scope and more i", "ntimate in character. Although there are frequent autograph sessions, they tend to be less of an attraction for volunteer cons. Admission to volunteer cons is usually termed \"membership\", thus emphasizing that the fans themselves are the ones who compose the convention, rather than the staff who manage commercial cons. A community of fans who run such conventions has developed, and many of them share their best practices and keep convention-running traditions alive.\n\n\n=== Comics festivals and \"indy shows\" ===\nSo-called \"comics festivals\" are based on a European model started by such long-running conventions as Lucca Comics & Games and the Angoul\u00eame International Comics Festival. Festivals emphasize the art and literature of the comics form, and only minimally related popular culture and merchandising. In the U.S., comics festival and \"indy shows\" tend to emphasize the \"alternative comics\" genre, not the work of \"mainstream\" publishers like DC Comics and Marvel Comics. Cosplaying is rarely if ever a feature of these conventions. Some notable North American small press conventions include:\n\nAlternative Press Expo (APE), San Jose, California (1994\u20132017) \u2013 produced in San Francisco for 15 years\nCartoon Crossroads Columbus (CXC), Columbus, Ohio (2015\u2013present)\nChicago Alternative Comics Expo (CAKE), Chicago, Illinois (2012\u2013present)\nComic Arts Brooklyn (CAB) (formerly known as Brooklyn Comics and Graphics Fest [BCGF]), Brooklyn, New York (2009\u2013present) \u2013 produced by the retailer Desert Island Comics\nComic Expo (Bristol International Comic & Small Press Expo), Bristol, England (2004\u20132014) \u2013 produced by retailer Mike Allwood\nEast Coast Black Age of Comics Convention (ECBACC), Philadelphia (2002\u2013present) \u2013 focuses on black creators and characters\nMassachusetts Independent Comics Expo (MICE), Boston, Massachusetts (2010\u2013present)\nMoCCA Festival, New York City (2002\u2013present) \u2013 originally produced by the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art; now produced by the Society of Illustrators", "\nSmall Press and Alternative Comics Expo (SPACE), Columbus, Ohio (2000\u2013present) \u2013 Produced by small-press publisher Back Porch Comics\nSmall Press Expo (SPX), Bethesda, Maryland (1994\u2013present)\nSTAPLE!, Austin, Texas (2005\u2013present)\nStumptown Comics Fest, Portland, Oregon (2004\u20132013)\nToronto Comic Arts Festival (TCAF), Toronto (2003\u2013present) \u2013 produced by the retailer The Beguiling\nLegion Comic Book, Toy and Art Convention Smyrna, Georgia (2019\u2013present) produced by Urbnpop Productions\n\n\n=== \"Comics-only\" shows ===\nComics-only conventions emerged in response to the sprawling popular culture-emphasizing conventions epitomized by Wizard Entertainment, San Diego Comic Con International, and the New York Comic Con. \"Comics-only\" shows tend to hearken back to the comic book conventions of the 1970s and 1980s: still emphasizing the genres of superhero, fantasy, horror, and crime; as well as dealers selling back issues and other collectibles, but without the domineering presence of the mainstream publishers, or movie and television producers. Notable \"comics-only\" conventions include: \n\nBaltimore Comic-Con (est. 2000 in Baltimore, Maryland)\nBig Apple Comic Con (est. 1996 in New York City)\nHeroes Convention (est. 1982 in Charlotte, North Carolina)\n\n\n== Organization and staffing ==\nComic book conventions were traditionally managed and staffed by volunteers, though venues may require certain activities to be contracted out. Event funding typically relies on convention registrations. Nowadays, many of the larger conventions are incorporated as non-profit organizations, usually to achieve tax-exempt status and safeguard the organizers' personal assets \u2013 in the USA, some are 501(c)(3) charities, while others are registered as recreational clubs. The largest events may require as many as a hundred volunteers. Volunteers often receive T-shirts or other benefits.\n\n\n== Timing and duration ==\nMost comic book conventions occur during a weekend, with events scheduled between Friday evening", " and Sunday afternoon.  Saturday is typically the busiest day, as most fans must return home on Sunday.  One-day passes are sometimes sold at a reduced price.\nReasons for this include:\n\nMost fans would have to take a vacation from work or study to attend an event held during the workweek.\nTransportation costs are often lower for weekend travelers.\nHotels have few business travelers during the weekend, making it much easier to reserve a block of rooms and secure space for programming at a reduced price. Many fans are students and have little discretionary income, so hotel and convention fees are important factors.\nIn 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, both WonderCon and Dragon Con were canceled, and San Diego Comic-Con moved its programming online.\n\n\n== Anatomy of a typical convention ==\n\nAlthough wide variations exist between different conventions, there is a general pattern to which most adhere.\n\n\n=== Attendees ===\nAttendees include artists and dealers offering products and services for sale to fans, and those who wish to buy them. Others come for the programming, or to meet friends or other comic book fans in general. Many attend for all of these reasons. Some later publish a \"con report\" detailing their experiences.\nAttendees of major conventions receive a bag with the convention program, a lavishly illustrated volume featuring themed artwork, articles submitted by members and the official guests, along with a description of the event's programming, staff, rules, guests, and any charity being supported by the convention. Local restaurant information and a combination pocket schedule and map may also be included. Sponsors often receive additional items such as T-shirts, pins, or ribbons, as well as faster registration badge pick-up and on-site meals. They may also be displayed prominently in convention publications.\n\n\n=== Official guests ===\nComic book conventions typically feature official guests or guests of honor.  A convention may have as many guests of honor", " as the convention committee wishes. A guest can be an industry person \u2013 some notable and frequently appearing examples of industry guests include Stan Lee, George P\u00e9rez, and John Byrne. More and more, guests also can include movie and television directors and actors, as more of these cultural products are based on comic books. Examples of this sort of guest, participating frequently with the convention circuit, include William Shatner, Bruce Campbell, and Norman Reedus. Comic conventions represent an opportunity for fans to interact with such individuals that may not be possible outside the event.\n\n\n=== Professionals at conventions ===\nConventions provide a forum for fans to see first-hand and meet their favorite authors and artists. They also serve the interests of authors, editors, and other publishing professionals, providing opportunities for networking, promotion, and a convenient location for contract negotiations and other business meetings.\nA number of cons include a category for \"Attending Professionals\": professionals who pay a (possibly reduced) price to enter but also get a special name badge that proclaims them to be professionals in the field.\nDuring the early days of comic book conventions, there was little or no distinction made between the \"pros\" and the \"fans\". (After all, many professionals began as fans, and may still consider themselves fans; and more than a few fans have also worked professionally or semi-professionally in the field.) Nowadays, other than in the so-called \"Artist Alleys\", there is more of a caste system among professionals and enthusiasts.\n\n\n==== Artist Alley ====\nArtist Alley is a fixture at most comic conventions. It is an area where creators display and sell their work (including original art), take commissions, sign autographs, and interact with fans. These areas may also include crafts, drawn art, self-published books or video, fanzines, and more.\n\n\n==== Con suite ====\nAt North American conventions, a hospitality suite is", " often provided as a room reserved for minor refreshments, quiet conversation, and a place to rest briefly. The refreshments typically include coffee, tea, juice or soda, and light meals appropriate for the time of day. Depending on local liquor distribution and liability laws, the suite may serve alcohol. At conventions in the rest of the world, the hotel or convention center bar typically offers the same social function. At conventions in the United Kingdom, the provision of cask ale is generally considered essential.\n\n\n=== Cosplay ===\nTraditionally, conventions held a costume contest called a masquerade, where persons go on stage and compete for nominal prizes based on their skill in assembling and presenting genre-inspired outfits. This, however, would be more accurately labelled a \"talent show\" rather than the \"fancy dress ball\" that the term suggests (although British fandom sometimes uses the term \"fancy dress\").\nFrom press coverage of comic book and anime conventions has arisen the widespread tendency of fans in general attendance at the con to dress as their favorite characters in elaborate costumes (known as cosplay) that are time-consuming and/or expensive to assemble.\n\n\n==== Weapons policies ====\nAt some conventions, attendees carry costume props that appear to be weapons. To forestall concerns about misuse of real weapons at such events, the security team \"peace-bonds\" anything that might look like a weapon. (Peace-bonding is a conspicuous lock, tie, or mark which makes or identifies something unusable, such as a weapon, and shows that the owner's intentions are purely peaceful.)\nThe event's \"weapons policy\" may offer objective criteria to determine what looks like a weapon. For example, a weapons policy may require a peace-bond for anything that a reasonable person might recognize as a weapon from a short distance in dim light. Real weapons, if allowed, are disabled, secured, and marked.  For example, bright orange zip ties may be used to hold a sword ", "in a scabbard or to hold a pistol in a holster. Simulated or costume props may require conspicuous marks, such as bright ribbons or zip ties, to show that security has deemed them safe to be carried. Simulated weapons or props which can be used as a weapon may be disabled or secured in the way as real weapons.  Peace-bonding helps security control the use or abuse of real weapons at a convention or other event: anything that looks like a weapon but which is not peace-bonded is immediately deemed to be suspicious.\n\n\n=== Programming ===\n\nPanel-led discussions, or Panels, usually fill up the daytime hours of most conventions with typically one-hour discussions involving some pre-determined topic, usually related in at least some way to comics.  Panels usually come in two segments: the host puts on a presentation or does an interview with a guest, and then the fans are asked to give questions. The topic scope for panels is varied and can include things from new releases to author spotlights.\nThere are also workshops, that are like panels but are more geared towards instructions through a major or specific task such as how to draw comics, or use industry-specific software. Another event at most comic book conventions include screenings of movies and TV shows that can last through the day.\nPanel members (even professionals) are not customarily paid for their appearance, although many North-American conventions waive membership fees for program participants or rebate them after the convention.\n\n\n=== Special events ===\nSome conventions feature award ceremonies, in which the best works and most notable individuals are recognized for their contributions to the field. [See Awards, below]\nA convention may have one or more auctions. The Art Auction is an event where the most popular items from the art show are sold to the most interested buyers at the convention. Many conventions also have auctions for charities.\nEvening entertainment often includes a combination of official and", " unofficial events, including formal invitational dinners, and fandom-themed room parties.\nA few conventions and festivals have a closing ceremony to formally mark the end of the convention. Depending on the convention, this can be a major gathering of most of the membership, or it may be lightly attended or dispensed with entirely as members are occupied with packing up and checking out of the hotel.\n\n\n=== Exhibits and fixed functions ===\nAn exhibit hall or dealers' room is a popular feature at comic book conventions. Publishing companies, distributors, and other proprietors often arrive to exhibit and/or sell their newest products to fans. Wares can include back issues of comic books, graphic novels and trade paperbacks, manga and anime media, action figures, apparel or pre-made costumes, music CDs, software, decorations, toys, art books, specialty foods, and many more.\nMany conventions have video rooms in which genre-related audiovisual presentations occur, typically commercial Hollywood movies, genre television show episodes, and anime. If there are multiple media rooms, each one may have themed content.  Larger conventions may also have a genuine movie room, for presentation of actual movies on film instead of video.\nGame rooms are also available at some conventions for attendees to play a variety of genre games, including collectible card games, role-playing games board games, and video games.\n\n\n=== Thematic Areas ===\n\nThematic areas are set up in the comics fairs where cosplayers and visitors can take photographs in an environment that imitates that of a specific comic, anime or video game or participate in various themed activities. These areas are set up by not for profit associations or sometimes by video game developers or Anime producers. Some examples of these areas are those dedicated to Star Wars, Fallout or to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\n\n=== Idiosyncrasy ===\nMany con-goers take pride in being interesting and unusual, and many conventions are idi", "osyncratic. Cons often have activities, running jokes, organizational methods, and other features that not only differentiate them from other cons but are often a point of pride. Most cons vary from the above outline in one or more important ways, and many have their own unique characteristics. Most cons will tend to evolve many of their own idiosyncrasies in this manner. To fans, these are often part of the charm each convention offers.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\nAlmost since their inception, comic book conventions have hosted comic awards. Two of the longest-running and most prestigious awards are the Eisner Award and the Harvey Award, both of which began in 1988 after the dissolution of the Kirby Awards. The Eisner Award has been presented at San Diego Comic-Con since 1988; while the Harvey Awards, also inaugurated in 1988 and after being presented at many different venues for much of their life, have been presented at the Baltimore Comic-Con since 2006.

It was the first U.S. city to host a convention (the 1964 \"Tri-State Con\"), but was poorly served for conventions from the late 1980s until the mid-to-late 1990s \u2013 despite both major mainstream comic publishers, DC Comics and Marvel Comics, being headquartered in New York during that time. Presently, New York is flush with comic book conventions, with at least five annual shows being produced. The following is a timeline of New York City comic book conventions.\n\n\n== Timeline of British comic book conventions ==\nEngland has hosted comic book conventions since 1968 (the British Comic Art Convention), but until the early 2000s had trouble sustaining any one recurring show. As of 2024, England is host to four long-running, large annual conventions \u2013 the MCM Comic Con London (est. 2002), the London Film and Comic Con (est. 2004), the Thought Bubble Festival (est. 2007), and The Lakes International Comic Art Festival (est. 2013).\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of comic book conventions\nList of defunct comic book conventions\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nDuncan, Randy; Smith, Matthew J (2009).

Its artists include Sam Kieth, Mike Dringenberg, Jill Thompson, Shawn McManus, Marc Hempel, Bryan Talbot, and Michael Zulli, with lettering by Todd Klein and covers by Dave McKean. The original series ran for 75 issues from January 1989 to March 1996. Beginning with issue No. 47, it was placed under DC's Vertigo imprint, and following Vertigo's retirement in 2020, reprints have been published under DC's Black Label imprint.\nThe titular main character of The Sandman is Dream, also known as Morpheus and other names, who is one of the seven Endless. The other Endless are Destiny, Death, Desire, Despair, Delirium (formerly Delight), and Destruction (also known as 'The Prodigal'). The series is famous for Gaiman's trademark use of anthropomorphic personification of various metaphysical entities, while also blending mythology and history in its horror setting within the DC Universe. The Sandman is a story about stories and how Morpheus, the Lord of Dreams, is captured and subsequently learns that sometimes change is inevitable. The Sandman was Vertigo's flagship title, and is available as a series of ten trade paperbacks, a recolored five-volume Absolute hardcover edition with slipcase, a three-volume omnibus edition, a black-and-white Annotated edition; it is also available for digital download.\nCritically acclaimed, The Sandman was among the first graphic novels to appear on The New York Times Best Seller list, along with Maus, Watchmen, and The Dark Knight Returns. It was one of six graphic novels to make Entertainment Weekly's \"100 best reads from 1983 to 2008\", ranking at No. 46. Norman Mailer described the series as \"a comic strip for intellectuals\". The series has exerted considerable influence over the fantasy genre and graphic novel medium since its publication and is often regarded as one of the greatest graphic novels of all time.\nVarious film and television versions of Sandman have ", "been developed. In 2013, Warner Bros. announced that a film adaptation starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt was in production, but Gordon-Levitt dropped out in 2016. In July 2020, September 2021 and September 2022, three full-cast audio dramas were released exclusively through Audible starring James McAvoy, which were narrated by Gaiman and dramatized and directed by Dirk Maggs. In August 2022, Netflix released a television adaptation starring Tom Sturridge.\n\n\n== Publication history ==\n\n\n=== Creation ===\nThe Sandman grew out of a proposal by Neil Gaiman to revive DC's 1974\u20131976 series The Sandman, written by Joe Simon and Michael Fleisher and illustrated by Jack Kirby and Ernie Chua. Gaiman had considered including characters from the \"Dream Stream\" (including the Kirby Sandman, Brute, Glob, and the brothers Cain and Abel) in a scene for the first issue of his 1988 miniseries Black Orchid. While the scene did not make it into later drafts because Roy Thomas was using the characters in Infinity, Inc., Gaiman soon began constructing a treatment for a new series, and mentioned his treatment in passing to DC editor Karen Berger. He was unsure his Sandman pitch would be accepted, but weeks later, Berger asked Gaiman if he was interested in doing a Sandman series. Gaiman recalled, \"I said, 'Um ... yes. Yes, definitely. What's the catch?' [Berger said,] 'There's only one. We'd like a new Sandman. Keep the name. But the rest is up to you.'\"\nGaiman crafted the new character from an initial image of \"a man, young, pale and naked, imprisoned in a tiny cell, waiting until his captors passed away... deathly thin, with long dark hair, and strange eyes\". Gaiman patterned the character's black attire on a print of a Japanese kimono as well as his own wardrobe. Gaiman wrote an eight-issue outline and gave it to Dave McKean and Leigh Baulch, who drew character sketches. Berger reviewed the sketches (along with some drawn by Gaiman) and suggested Sam Kieth as the series' artist. Mike Dringen", "berg, Todd Klein, Robbie Busch, and Dave McKean were hired as inker, letterer, colorist, and cover artist, respectively. McKean's approach towards comics covers was unconventional, and he convinced Berger that the series' protagonist did not need to appear on every cover.\nThe first seven issues were inspired and influenced by early DC and EC Comics, and authors like Dennis Wheatley, Clive Barker, Ramsey Campbell, Robert Heinlein and Alan Moore, but with issue eight he says he finally found his own voice.\nGaiman's approach to scripting the series became more difficult as the complex storyline and characters developed. \"When I began writing Sandman, it would take me a couple of weeks to write a script. As time went by I got slower and slower, until a script was taking me six weeks to a month to write.\"\n\n\n=== Original series ===\nThe debut issue of The Sandman went on sale November 29, 1988 and was cover-dated January 1989. Gaiman described the early issues as \"awkward\", since he, as well as Kieth, Dringenberg, and Busch, had never worked on a regular series before. Kieth quit after the fifth issue; he was replaced by Dringenberg as penciler, who was in turn replaced by Malcolm Jones III as inker. Dave McKean was the cover artist for the series through its entire run.\nThe character then appeared in two of DC's \"Suggested for Mature Readers\" titles. In Swamp Thing vol. 2 No. 84 (March 1989), Dream and Eve allow Matthew Cable to live in the Dreaming because he died there, resurrecting him as a raven. He then meets John Constantine in Hellblazer No. 19 leading into the latter's guest appearance in Sandman No. 3 (March 1989).\nGaiman revisited Hell as depicted by Alan Moore in Swamp Thing, beginning with a guest appearance by Jack Kirby's Etrigan the Demon in issue No. 4 (April 1989). The story introduces Hell's Hierarchy (as their entry is titled in Who's Who in the DC Universe), headed by Lucifer (who would spin off into his own series in 1999), Beelzebub (later adversary ", "to Kid Eternity), and Azazel, whom Dream defeated later in the series. Dream visited the Justice League International in the following issue, No. 5 (May 1989). Although multiple mainstream DC characters appeared in the series throughout its run, such as Martian Manhunter and Scarecrow, this would not be the norm. Gaiman and artist Mike Dringenberg introduced Death, the older sister of Dream, in issue No. 8 (August 1989).\nGaiman began incorporating elements of the Kirby Sandman series in issue No. 11 (December 1989), including the changes implemented by Roy Thomas. Joe Simon and Michael Fleisher had treated the character, who resembled a superhero, as the \"true\" Sandman. The Thomas and Gaiman stories revealed that the character's existence was a sham created by two nightmares who had escaped to a pocket of the Dreaming. Brute and Glob would later attempt this again on Sanderson Hawkins, sidekick to Wesley Dodds, the Golden Age Sandman. Gaiman gave Jed Walker a surname and made him related to several new characters. The Thomas Sandman was Hector Hall, who married the already-pregnant Fury in the Dreaming in Infinity, Inc. No. 51. It was explained that Dr. Garrett Sanford, the 1970s Simon and Kirby version of the Sandman, had gone insane from the loneliness of the Dream Dimension and taken his own life. Brute and Glob put the spirit of Hector Hall, which had been cast out of his own body, into Sanford's body, and it eventually began to resemble Hall's. Fury, in her civilian guise as Lyta Hall, was the only superhero recurring character in the series. Even at that, her powers had come to her via the Fury Tisiphone, and the Furies, under the euphemism, \"the Kindly Ones\", a translation of \"Eumenides\", a name they earned during the events of Aeschylus's Oresteia trilogy, are major characters in the series.\nThe series follows a tragic course in which Dream, having learned a great deal from his imprisonment, tries to correct the things he has done wrong in the past. Ultimate", "ly, this causes him to mercy kill his own son, which leads to his own death at the hands of the Furies. Dream, having found himself a replacement early on in Daniel Hall, dies in issue No. 69 (July 1995). The remaining issues deal with Dream's funeral, Hob Gadling choosing to remain immortal in spite of Dream's death, and two stories from the past. The series wraps with the story of William Shakespeare creating his other commission for Dream, The Tempest, his last work not in collaboration with other writers.\nThe Sandman became a cult success for DC Comics and attracted an audience unlike that of mainstream comics: much of the readership was female, many were in their twenties, and many read no other comics at all. Comics historian Les Daniels called Gaiman's work \"astonishing\" and noted that The Sandman was \"a mixture of fantasy, horror, and ironic humor such as comic books had never seen before\". DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed that \"The Sandman became the first extraordinary success as a series of graphic novel collections, reaching out and converting new readers to the medium, particularly young women on college campuses, and making Gaiman himself into an iconic cultural figure.\" Gaiman had a finite run in mind for the series, and it concluded with issue No. 75. Gaiman said in 1996, \"Could I do another five issues of Sandman? Well, damn right. And would I be able to look at myself in the mirror happily? No. Is it time to stop because I've reached the end, yes, and I think I'd rather leave while I'm in love.\" The final issue, No. 75, was dated March 1996.\n\n\n=== Additions and spin-offs ===\n\nThe Sandman has inspired numerous spin-offs. While most of these are not written by Gaiman, he did write two miniseries focusing on the character of Death. Death: The High Cost of Living was published from March to May 1993 and was based on the fable that Death takes human form once a century to remain grounded and in touch with humanity. This was followed i", "n 1996 by Death: The Time of Your Life, featuring the characters of Foxglove and Hazel from A Game of You. Other spin-offs include The Dreaming, Lucifer, and Dead Boy Detectives.\nA set of Sandman trading cards was issued in 1994 by SkyBox International.\nIn 1999, Gaiman wrote The Sandman: The Dream Hunters, a novella illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano. As in many of the single-issue stories throughout The Sandman, Morpheus appears in Dream Hunters, but only as a supporting character. In Gaiman's afterword to the book, he describes the story as a retelling of an existing Japanese legend. There is no trace of it in the primary source he cites, and when asked, Gaiman has stated that he made up the \"legend\". The novel was later adapted into a four-issue miniseries by P. Craig Russell and released by Vertigo from January 2009 to April 2009.\nGaiman and Matt Wagner co-wrote Sandman Midnight Theatre, a 1995 prestige format one-shot in which Dream and Wesley Dodds meet in person after the events in the storyline, \"The Python\", which ended with Dodds's lover, Dian Belmont, going to England, which eventually brings both her and Dodds to Roderick Burgess's mansion. In 2001, Dream appeared in a flashback in Green Arrow vol. 3, No. 9, which takes place at a point during the 70 years of the first issue.\nGaiman wrote several new stories about Morpheus and his siblings, one story for each, which were published in 2003 as the Endless Nights anthology. The stories are set throughout history, but two take place after the final events of the monthly series. It was written by Gaiman and featured a different illustrator for each story. This collection was the first hardcover graphic novel ever to appear on The New York Times Hardcover Best Seller list.\nWriter/artist Jill Thompson wrote and illustrated several stories featuring the Sandman characters. These include the manga-style book Death: At Death's Door, one of DC's best-selling books of 2003, set during the events of Season of Mists, and ", "The Little Endless Storybook, a children's book using childlike versions of the Endless.\nTo commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of The Sandman, Gaiman wrote a new tale involving the battle that had exhausted Morpheus prior to the beginning of the original story. Written by Gaiman and with art by J. H. Williams III, Overture tells the previously hinted story of Dream's adventure prior to Preludes and Nocturnes, which had exhausted him so much that it made Burgess' actions capable of capturing him. The limited series had six issues. Issue #1 was released on October 30, 2013, and although it was planned to have a bi-monthly release schedule, issue 2 was delayed until March 2014, which Gaiman explained was \"mostly due to the giant signing tour I was on from June, and me not getting script written on the tour, with knock-on effects\". Special editions were released approximately a month after the original editions, which contain interviews with the creative team, alongside rare artwork.\nIn 2018, DC announced The Sandman Universe, a new line of comics exploring The Sandman's part of the DC Universe. It started in August 2018.\n\n\n== Summary ==\n\nThe Sandman's main character is Dream, the eponymous Sandman, also known to various characters throughout the series as Morpheus, Oneiros, the Shaper, the Shaper of Form, Lord of the Dreaming, the Dream King, Dream-Sneak, the Cat of Dreams, Murphy, Kai'ckul and Lord L'Zoril, who is the anthropomorphic personification of dreams. At the start of the series, Morpheus is captured by an occult ritual and held prisoner for 70 years. Morpheus escapes in the modern day and after avenging himself upon his captors, sets about rebuilding his kingdom, which has fallen into disrepair in his absence. The character's initial haughty and often cruel manner begins to soften after his years of imprisonment at the start of the series, but the challenge of undoing past sins and changing old ways is an enormous one for a being who has been set in his", " ways for billions of years. In its beginnings, the series is a very dark horror comic. Later, the series evolves into an elaborate fantasy series, incorporating elements of classical and contemporary mythology, ultimately placing its protagonist in the role of a tragic hero.\nThe storylines primarily take place in the Dreaming, Morpheus's realm, and the waking world, with occasional visits to other domains, such as Hell, Faerie, Asgard, and the domains of the other Endless. Many use the contemporary United States of America and the United Kingdom as a backdrop. The DC Universe was the official setting of the series, but well-known DC characters and places were rarely featured after 1990. A notable exception is Lyta Hall, formerly Fury of the 1980s super-team Infinity, Inc., who figures prominently in the \"Kindly Ones\" story arc, and her superhuman abilities are not ignored. Most of the storylines take place in modern times, but many short stories are set in the past, taking advantage of the immortal nature of many of the characters, and deal with historical individuals and events such as in the short story \"Men of Good Fortune\".\n\n\n== Themes and genre ==\nThe Sandman comic book series falls within the dark fantasy genre, albeit in a more contemporary and modern setting. Critic Marc Buxton described the book as a \"masterful tale that created a movement of mature dark fantasy\" which was largely unseen in previous fantasy works before it. The comic book also falls into the genres of urban fantasy, epic fantasy, historical drama, and superhero. It is written as a metaphysical examination of the elements of fiction, which Neil Gaiman accomplished through the artistic use of unique anthropomorphic personifications, mythology, legends, historical figures and occult culture, making up most of the major and minor characters as well as the plot device and even the settings of the story. In its earliest story arcs, the Sandman mythos existed primarily in the DC Universe, and as ", "such numerous DC characters made some appearances or were mentioned. Later, the series would reference the DCU less often, while continuing to exist in the same universe.\nCritic Hilary Goldstein described the comic book as \"about the concept of dreams more so than the act of dreaming\". In the early issues, responsibility and rebirth were the primary themes of the story. As Dream finally liberates himself from his occultist captors, he returns to his kingdom which had fallen on hard times due to his absence, while also facing his other siblings, who each have their own reaction to his return. The story is structured not as a series of unconnected events nor as an incoherent dream, but by having each panel have a specific purpose in the flow of the story. Dreams became the core of every story arc written in the series, and the protagonist's journey became more distinct and deliberate. Many Vertigo books since, such as Transmetropolitan and Y: The Last Man, have adopted this kind of format in their writing, creating a traditional prose only seen in the imprint.\n\n\n== Collected editions ==\nThe Sandman was initially published as a monthly serial, in 32-page comic books with some exceptions to this pattern. The stories within were usually 24 pages long, with eight exceptions within the main story arc: issue #1, \"Sleep of the Just\" (40 pages); issue #14, \"Collectors\" (38 pages); issue #32, \"Slaughter on Fifth Avenue\" (25 pages); issue #33, \"Lullabies of Broadway\" (23 pages); issue #36, \"Over the Sea to Sky\" (39 pages); issue #50, \"Distant Mirrors\u2014Ramadan\" (32 pages); issue #52, \"Cluracan's Tale\" (25 pages); issue #75, \"The Tempest\" (38 pages). As the series increased in popularity, DC Comics began to reprint them in hardcover and trade paperback editions, each representing either a complete novel or a collection of related short stories.\nDC first published \"The Doll's House\" storyline in a collection called simply The Sandman. Shortly thereafter, the first three volumes wer", "e published and named independently and collected in a boxed set. (Death's debut story, \"The Sound of Her Wings\" from issue #8, appeared both at the beginning of early editions of The Doll's House and at the end of Preludes and Nocturnes, creating overlap between the first two volumes.) In 1998, the cover images from The Sandman were released as one compiled volume titled Dustcovers: The Collected Sandman Covers. Dave McKean's covers use techniques such as painting, sculpture, photography, drawing, and computer manipulation.\n\n\n=== Trade paperbacks ===\nA total of ten trade paperbacks contain the full run of the series and have all been kept in print.

Williams III, the series tells the previously untold story that led to Morpheus' capture by Roderick Burgess in the first issue of the monthly series.\n\n\n==== 30th Anniversary editions ====\nIn 2018 DC republished the previous ten trade paperbacks in a new 30th anniversary edition, along with Endless Nights, now numbered as Volume 11, both prose and comic versions of The Dream Hunters as separate unnumbered volumes and Overture as Volume \u221e.\n\n\n=== Absolute editions ===\nThe DC Comics Absolute Edition series are large 8\" by 12\" prints of a considerably higher quality and price than the library edition, and include a leather-like cover and a slipcase.

The Sandman and its spin-offs have won more than 26 Eisner Awards, including three for Best Continuing Series, one for Best Short Story, four for Best Writer (Neil Gaiman), seven for Best Lettering (Todd Klein), and two for Best Penciller/Inker (one each for Charles Vess and P. Craig Russell). The Sandman: The Dream Hunters was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Related Book in 2000. The Dream Hunters and Endless Nights won the Bram Stoker Award for Best Illustrated Narrative in 1999 and 2003, respectively. That same year, Season of Mists won the Angoul\u00eame International Comics Festival Prize for Scenario. In 2005, IGN declared Th", "e Sandman as the best Vertigo comic ever. The Sandman: Overture, a prequel mini-series, earned the 2016 Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story.\nHillary Goldstein of IGN praised the comic book, saying that it\n\nis truly the cream of the crop when it comes to Vertigo books. Neil Gaiman's work on the series is considered legendary for a reason. This story, in its entirety, is every bit as good as Watchmen and of equal (if not greater) literary merit. Were I to list the 100 best single comic-book issues I have ever read, three would come from this collection. Whether you have read The Sandman before or are a first timer, this is the one book you need to buy this fall. The stories within are magnificent and the care taken in reproducing Gaiman's work is the same you'd expect for any great work of literature.\n\n\n== Adaptations into other media ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\nThroughout the late 1990s, a film adaptation of the comic was periodically planned by Warner Bros., parent company of DC Comics. Roger Avary was originally attached to direct after the success of Pulp Fiction, collaborating with Pirates of the Caribbean screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio in 1996 on a revision of their first script draft, which merged the \"Preludes and Nocturnes\" storyline with that of \"The Doll's House\". Avary intended the film to be in part visually inspired by animator Jan \u0160vankmajer's work. Avary was fired after disagreements over the creative direction with executive producer Jon Peters, best known for the 1989 film Batman and the abandoned project Superman Lives. It was due to their meeting on the Sandman film project that Avary and Gaiman collaborated one year later on the script for Beowulf. The project carried on through several more writers and scripts. A later draft by William Farmer, reviewed at Ain't It Cool News, was met with scorn from fans. Gaiman called the last screenplay that Warner Bros. would send him \"not only the worst Sandman script I've ever seen, but quite easily the worst", " script I've ever read\". Gaiman has said that his dissatisfaction with how his characters were being treated had dissuaded him from writing any more stories involving the Endless, although he has since written Endless Nights and Sandman Overture.\nBy 2001, the project had become stranded in development hell. In a Q&A panel at Comic-Con 2007, Gaiman remarked, \"I'd rather see no Sandman movie made than a bad Sandman movie. But I feel like the time for a Sandman movie is coming soon. We need someone who has the same obsession with the source material as Peter Jackson had with Lord of the Rings or Sam Raimi had with Spider-Man.\" That same year, he stated that he could imagine Terry Gilliam as a director for the adaptation: \"I would always give anything to Terry Gilliam, forever, so if Terry Gilliam ever wants to do Sandman then as far as I'm concerned Terry Gilliam should do Sandman.\" In 2013, DC President Diane Nelson said that a Sandman film would be as rich as the Harry Potter universe. David S. Goyer announced in an interview in early December that he would be producing an adaptation of the graphic novel, alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Neil Gaiman. Jack Thorne was hired to write the script. On October 16, 2014, Gaiman clarified that while the film was not announced with the DC slate by Warner Bros., it would instead be distributed by Vertigo and announced with those slate of films. Goyer told Deadline Hollywood in an interview that the studio was very happy with the film's script. According to Deadline Hollywood, the film was to be distributed by New Line Cinema. In October 2015, Goyer revealed that a new screenwriter was being brought on board to revise the script by Jack Thorne and stated that he believed the film would go into production the following year. In March 2016, The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Eric Heisserer was hired to rewrite the film's script. The next day, Gordon-Levitt announced that he had dropped out due to disagreements with the studio ", "over the creative direction of the film. On November 9, 2016, i09 reported that Heisserer had turned in his draft of the script but left the film, stating that the film should be an HBO series instead.\nDeath\n\nIn a DC Showcase animated short, Death made her first official appearance outside of comics. In the short, Death (voiced by Jamie Chung) meets Vincent (voiced by Leonardo Nam), a failed artist struggling with his personal demons. It was directed by Sam Liu, and written by J. M. DeMatteis. The short was released as a special feature with the Wonder Woman: Bloodlines Blu-Ray.\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n==== The Sandman ====\n\nDue to the prolonged development period of the film, in 2010, DC Entertainment shifted focus onto developing a television series adaptation. Film director James Mangold pitched a series concept to cable channel HBO, whilst consulting with Gaiman himself on an unofficial basis, but this proved to be unsuccessful. It was reported in September 2010 that Warner Bros. Television was licensing the rights to produce a TV series, and that Supernatural creator Eric Kripke was their preferred candidate to adapt the saga. In March 2011, it was announced via Neil Gaiman's web blog that while he and DC liked Eric Kripke and his approach, it did not feel quite right. The author hoped to launch the series in another form but plans for a television adaptation are on hold as production moves forward on the film. As the film adaptation of Morpheus' story was being planned, DC and Fox discussed a possible TV series based on the Sandman character Lucifer.\nNetflix announced in June 2019 that it had completed a deal with Warner Bros. to develop Sandman into a live-action television series run by Allan Heinberg, with Gaiman and Goyer serving as executive producers. The cast, including Tom Sturridge as the title character, was announced in January and May 2021.\nThe series premiered on August 5, 2022, and adapts Preludes & Nocturnes, The Doll's House, and the beginning o", "f Dream Country.\n\n\n==== Lucifer ====\n\nOn September 16, 2014, Deadline reported that DC and Fox were developing a television series based on the Sandman character Lucifer created by Neil Gaiman. On February 19, 2015, the official pilot order was given. According to the premise reported by The Hollywood Reporter, the potential series would greatly differ from the comic book version of the character featured in The Sandman and his own solo comic book series. Lucifer would be featured in a CSI-like or Elementary style television show with supernatural elements. The show began airing on January 25, 2016, and concluded on September 10, 2021\n\n\n==== Dead Boy Detectives ====\n\nSebastian Croft and Ty Tennant portrayed Payne and Rowland in the third season of the Doom Patrol TV series. The series also features their medium companion Crystal Palace, portrayed by Madalyn Horcher.\nHBO Max has ordered a pilot for a potential Dead Boy Detectives series in September 2021. The pilot was written by Steve Yockey, also acting as an executive producer alongside Jeremy Carver. The pilot also features Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schechter, and David Madden as executive producers under Berlanti Productions. The main cast for the pilot, as announced in November 2021, includes Jayden Revri as Edwin Payne, George Rexstrew as Charles Rowland, and Kassius Nelson as Crystal Palace. The series was picked up by HBO Max for an eight-episode first season in April 2022, but transferred to Netflix in February 2023. Additional cast members include Briana Cuoco as Jenny the Butcher, Yuyu Kitamura as Niko, Jenn Lyon as Esther, and Ruth Connell reprising her Doom Patrol role of Night Nurse.\n\n\n=== Audio ===\nOn July 15, 2020, Audible released an adaptation of the comic book series as a multi-part audio drama directed by Dirk Maggs with music by James Hannigan, adapting Preludes & Nocturnes, The Doll's House, and Dream Country.

Books are typically composed of many pages, bound together and protected by a cover. Modern bound books were preceded by many other written mediums, such as the codex, the scroll and the tablet. The book publishing process is the series of steps involved in their creation and dissemination.\nAs a conceptual object, a book typically refers to a written work of substantial length, which may be distributed either physically or in digital forms like ebooks. These works are broadly classified into fiction (containing imaginary content) and non-fiction (containing content representing truths). Many smaller categories exist within these, such as children's literature meant to match the reading level and interests of children, or reference works that gather collections of non-fiction. Books are traded at both regular stores and specialized bookstores, and can be borrowed from libraries. The reception of books has led to a number of social consequences, including censorship.\nA physical book may not contain a written work: for example, it may contain only drawings, engravings, photographs, puzzles, or removable content like paper dolls. Physical books may be left empty to be used for writing or drawing, as in the case of account books, appointment books, autograph books, notebooks, diaries and sketchbooks.\nThe contemporary book industry has seen several major changes due to new technologies. In some markets, the sale of printed books has decreased due to the increased use of ebooks. However, printed books still largely outsell ebooks, and many people have a preference for print. The 21st century has also seen a rapid rise in the popularity of audiobooks, which are recordings of books being read aloud. Additionally, awareness of the needs of people who have difficulty accessing print media due to disabilities like visual impairment has led to a rise in formats designed for greater accessibility, such", " as braille printing or formats supporting text-to-voice. Google Books estimated that as of 2010, approximately 130,000,000 unique books had been published.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word book comes from Old English b\u014dc, which in turn comes from the Germanic root *b\u014dk-, cognate to 'beech'. In Slavic languages like Russian, Bulgarian, Macedonian \u0431\u0443\u043a\u0432\u0430 bukva\u2014'letter' is cognate with 'beech'. In Russian, Serbian and Macedonian, the word \u0431\u0443\u043a\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044c (bukvar') or \u0431\u0443\u043a\u0432\u0430\u0440 (bukvar) refers to a primary school textbook that helps young children master the techniques of reading and writing. It is thus conjectured that the earliest Indo-European writings may have been carved on beech wood. The Latin word codex, meaning a book in the modern sense (bound and with separate leaves), originally meant 'block of wood'.\nAn avid reader or collector of books is a bibliophile, or colloquially a \"bookworm\".\n\n\n== Definitions ==\nIn its modern incarnation, a physical book is typically a collection of pages (most commonly of paper, parchment, or vellum) that are bound together and protected by a cover. By extension, 'book' may refer to a physical book's written, printed, or graphic contents.\nA single part or division of a longer written work may also be called a book, especially for some works composed in antiquity: each part of Aristotle's Physics, for example, is a book.\nIt is difficult to create an exact definition of books that clearly delineates them from other kinds of written material across time and culture. Many physical mediums for communication have existed throughout history, and the question of whether a particular object is a book may be subjective and contentious (as in the case of ebooks). Historian of books James Raven has suggested that when studying how books have been used to communicate, they should be defined in a broadly inclusive way as \"portable, durable, replicable and legible\" means of recording and disseminating information, rather than by physical or contextual features. T", "his would include, for example, ebooks, newspapers, and quipus (a form of knot-based recording historically used by cultures in Andean South America), but not objects fixed in place such as inscribed monuments.\nStricter definitions appear in other specialized contexts. For the purpose of recording national statistics on book production, UNESCO recommended that a book be defined as \"a non-periodical printed publication of at least 49 pages, exclusive of the cover pages, published in the country and made available to the public\", distinguishing them from other written material such as pamphlets.\nAlthough in academic language a monograph is understood to be a specialist work on a single subject, in library and information science the term is sometimes used more broadly to mean any non-serial publication complete in one volume (a physical book) or a definite number of volumes (such as a multi-volume novel), in contrast to serial or periodical publications.\n\n\n== History of books ==\n\nThe history of books became an acknowledged academic discipline in the 1980s. Contributions to the field have come from textual scholarship, codicology, bibliography, philology, palaeography, art history, social history and cultural history. Its key purpose is to demonstrate that the book as an object, not just the text contained within it, is a conduit of interaction between readers and words. Analysis of each component part of the book reveals its purpose, where and how it was kept, who read it, ideological and religious beliefs of the period, and whether readers interacted with the text within. Even a lack of evidence of this nature leaves valuable clues about the nature of that particular book.\nThe earliest forms of writing were etched on stone slabs, transitioning to palm leaves and papyrus in ancient times. Parchment and paper later emerged as important substrates for bookmaking, introducing greater durability and accessibility. Across regions like China, the Middle East, Europe, and So", "uth Asia, diverse methods of book production evolved. The Middle Ages saw the rise of illuminated manuscripts, intricately blending text and imagery, particularly during the Mughal era in South Asia under the patronage of rulers like Akbar and Shah Jahan. Prior to the invention of the printing press, made famous by the Gutenberg Bible, each text was a unique handcrafted valuable article, personalized through the design features incorporated by the scribe, owner, bookbinder, and illustrator.\nThe invention of the printing press in the 15th century marked a pivotal moment, revolutionizing book production. Innovations like movable type and steam-powered presses accelerated manufacturing processes and contributed to increased literacy rates. Copyright protection also emerged, securing authors' rights and shaping the publishing landscape. The Late Modern Period introduced chapbooks, catering to a wider range of readers, and mechanization of the printing process further enhanced efficiency.\nThe 20th century witnessed the advent of typewriters, computers, and desktop publishing, transforming document creation and printing. Digital advancements in the 21st century led to the rise of e-books, propelled by the popularity of e-readers and accessibility features. While discussions about the potential decline of physical books have surfaced, print media has proven remarkably resilient, continuing to thrive as a multi-billion dollar industry. Additionally, efforts to make literature more inclusive emerged, with the development of Braille for the visually impaired and the creation of spoken books, providing alternative ways for individuals to access and enjoy literature.\n\n\n=== Notable advances ===\n\n\n==== Tablet ====\nSome of the earliest written records were made on tablets. Clay tablets (flattened pieces of clay impressed with a stylus) were used in the Ancient Near East throughout the Bronze Age and well into the Iron Age, especially for writing in cuneiform. Wax tablets (pieces o", "f wood covered in a layer of wax) were used in classical antiquity and throughout the Middle Ages.\nThe custom of binding several wax tablets together (Roman pugillares) is a possible precursor of modern bound books. The etymology of the word codex (block of wood) suggests that it may have developed from wooden wax tablets.\n\n\n==== Scroll ====\n\nScrolls made from papyrus were first used for writing in Ancient Egypt, perhaps as early as the First Dynasty, although the earliest evidence is from the account books of King Neferirkare Kakai of the Fifth Dynasty (about 2400 BC). According to Herodotus (History 5:58), the Phoenicians brought writing and papyrus to Greece around the 10th or 9th century BC. Whether made from papyrus, parchment, or paper, scrolls were the dominant writing medium in the Hellenistic, Roman, Chinese, Hebrew, and Macedonian cultures. The codex dominated in the Roman world by late antiquity, but scrolls persisted much longer in Asia.\n\n\n==== Codex ====\n\nThe codex is the ancestor of the modern book, consisting of sheets of uniform size bound along one edge and typically held between two covers made of some more robust material. Isidore of Seville (died 636) explained the then-current relation between a codex, book, and scroll in his Etymologiae (VI.13): \"A codex is composed of many books; a book is of one scroll. It is called codex by way of metaphor from the trunks (codex) of trees or vines, as if it were a wooden stock, because it contains in itself a multitude of books, as it were of branches\".\nThe first written mention of the codex as a form of book is from Martial, in his Apophoreta CLXXXIV at the end of the first century, where he praises its compactness. However, the codex never gained much popularity in the pagan Hellenistic world, and only within the Christian community did it gain widespread use. This change happened gradually during the 3rd and 4th centuries, and the reasons for adopting the codex form of the book were several: the format wa", "s more economical than the scroll, as both sides of the writing material can be used; and it was portable, searchable, and easier to conceal. The Christian authors may also have wanted to distinguish their writings from the pagan and Judaic texts written on scrolls.\nThe codices of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica had the same form as the European codex, but were instead made with long folded strips of either fig bark (amatl) or plant fibers, often with a layer of whitewash applied before writing. New World codices were written as late as the 16th century (see Maya codices and Aztec codices). Those written before the Spanish conquests seem all to have been single long sheets folded concertina-style, sometimes written on both sides of the local amatl paper.\n\n\n==== Manuscript ====\n\nManuscripts, handwritten and hand-copied documents, were the only form of writing before the invention and widespread adoption of print. Advances were made in the techniques used to create them.\nIn the early Western Roman Empire, monasteries continued Latin writing traditions related to Christianity, and the clergy were the predominant readers and copyists. The bookmaking process was long and laborious. They were usually written on parchment or vellum, writing surfaces made from processed animal skin. The parchment had to be prepared, then the unbound pages were planned and ruled with a blunt tool or lead, after which the text was written by a scribe, who usually left blank areas for illustration and rubrication. Finally, it was bound by a bookbinder.\nBecause of the difficulties involved in making and copying books, they were expensive and rare. Smaller monasteries usually had only a few dozen books. By the 9th century, larger collections held around 500 volumes and even at the end of the Middle Ages, the papal library in Avignon and Paris library of the Sorbonne held only around 2,000 volumes.\nThe rise of universities in the 13th century led to an increased demand for books, and a new system for c", "opying appeared. The books were divided into unbound leaves (pecia), which were lent out to different copyists, so the speed of book production was considerably increased. The system was maintained by secular stationers guilds, which produced both religious and non-religious material.\n\n In India bound manuscripts made of birch bark or palm leaf had existed since antiquity. The text in palm leaf manuscripts was inscribed with a knife pen on rectangular cut and cured palm leaf sheets; coloring was then applied to the surface and wiped off, leaving the ink in the incised grooves. Each sheet typically had a hole through which a string could pass, and with these the sheets were tied together with a string to bind like a book.\n\n\n==== Woodblock printing ====\n\nIn woodblock printing, a relief image of an entire page is carved into blocks of wood, inked, and used to print copies of that page. It originated in the Han dynasty before 220 AD, used to print textiles and later paper, and was widely used throughout East Asia. The oldest dated book printed by this method is The Diamond Sutra (868 AD). The method (called woodcut when used in art) arrived in Europe in the early 14th century. Books (known as block-books), as well as playing-cards and religious pictures, began to be produced by this method. Creating an entire book was a painstaking process, requiring a hand-carved block for each page, and the wooden blocks could crack if stored for too long.\n\n\n==== Movable type and incunabula ====\n\nThe Chinese inventor Bi Sheng made movable type of earthenware c.\u20091045, but there are no known surviving examples of his printing. Around 1450, Johannes Gutenberg independently invented movable type in Europe, along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and hand mould. This invention gradually made books less expensive to produce and more widely available. Early printed books, single sheets and images which were created before 1501 in Europe are known as incunables or incunab", "ula.\n\n\n==== 19th century to 21st century ====\nSteam-powered printing presses became popular in the early 19th century. These machines could print 1,100 sheets per hour, but workers could only set 2,000 letters per hour. monotype and linotype typesetting machines were introduced in the late 19th century. They could set more than 6,000 letters per hour and an entire line of type at once. There have been numerous improvements in the printing press. In mid-20th century, European book production had risen to over 200,000 titles per year.\nThroughout the 20th century, libraries have faced an ever-increasing rate of publishing, sometimes called an information explosion. The advent of electronic publishing and the internet means that much new information is published online rather than in printed books, for example through a digital library. Though many books are produced digitally, most digital versions are not available to the public, and there is no decline in the rate of paper publishing. There have also been new developments in the process of publishing books. Technologies such as POD or \"print on demand\", which make it possible to print as few as one book at a time, have made self-publishing (and vanity publishing) much easier and more affordable. On-demand publishing has allowed publishers, by avoiding the high costs of warehousing, to keep low-selling books in print rather than declaring them out of print.\n\n\n== Contemporary publishing ==\n\nPresently, books are often produced by a publishing company for the sake of being put on the market by distributors and bookstores. The company negotiates with authors in order to reach a formal legal agreement to obtain the copyright to works, then arranges for them to be produced and sold. The major steps of the publishing process are: editing and proofreading the work to be published; designing the printed book; manufacturing the books; and selling the book, including marketing and promotion. Each of these steps is usually taken ", "on by third-party companies paid by the publisher. This is in contrast to self-publishing, where an author arranges to publish their work without the involvement of a publishing company.\nEnglish-language publishing is currently dominated by the so-called \"Big Five\" publishers: Penguin Random House, Hachette Book Group, HarperCollins, Simon and Schuster, and Macmillan Publishers. They were estimated to make up almost 60 percent of the market for general-readership books in 2021.\n\n\n=== Design ===\n\nBook design is the art of incorporating the content, style, format, design, and sequence of the various components and elements of a book into a coherent unit. In the words of renowned typographer Jan Tschichold (1902\u20131974), book design, \"though largely forgotten today, [relies upon] methods and rules upon which it is impossible to improve, [and which] have been developed over centuries. To produce perfect books, these rules have to be brought back to life and applied\". Richard Hendel describes book design as \"an arcane subject\", and refers to the need for a context to understand what that means.\n\n\n==== Layout ====\n\nModern books are organized according to a particular format called the book's layout. Although there is great variation in layout, modern books tend to adhere to a set of rules with regard to what the parts of the layout are and what their content usually includes. A basic layout will include a front cover, a back cover and the book's content which is called its body copy or content pages. The front cover often bears the book's title (and subtitle, if any) and the name of its author or editor(s). The inside front cover page is usually left blank in both hardcover and paperback books. The next section, if present, is the book's front matter, which includes all textual material after the front cover but not part of the book's content such as a foreword, a dedication, a table of contents and publisher data such as the book's edition or printing number and place of p", "ublication. Between the body copy and the back cover goes the end matter which would include any indices, sets of tables, diagrams, glossaries or lists of cited works (though an edited book with several authors usually places cited works at the end of each authored chapter). The inside back cover page, like that inside the front cover, is usually blank. The back cover is the usual place for the book's ISBN and maybe a photograph of the author(s)/ editor(s), perhaps with a short introduction to them. Also here often appear plot summaries, barcodes and excerpted reviews of the book.\nThe body of the books is usually divided into parts, chapters, sections and sometimes subsections that are composed of at least a paragraph or more.\n\n\n==== Illustration ====\n\nThe illustration of handwritten manuscript books was well established in ancient times, and the tradition of the illuminated manuscript thrived in the West until the invention of printing. Other parts of the world had comparable traditions, such as the Persian miniature. Woodblock printing emerged in China, spread to Japan by the 9th century, and spread across Europe in the 13th century. Modern book illustration comes from the 15th-century woodcut illustrations that were fairly rapidly included in early printed books, and later block books. Other techniques such as engraving, etching, and lithography expanded the possibilities and were notably used by the French artists Daumier, Dor\u00e9, and Gavarni.\n\n\n=== Manufacturing ===\n\nThe methods used for the printing and binding of books continued fundamentally unchanged from the 15th century into the early 20th century. While there was more mechanization, a book printer in 1900 still used movable metal type assembled into words, lines, and pages to create copies. Modern paper books are printed on paper designed specifically for printing. Traditionally, book papers are off-white or low-white papers (easier to read), are opaque to minimize the show-through of text from one side of", " the page to the other and are (usually) made to tighter caliper or thickness specifications, particularly for case-bound books. Different paper qualities are used depending on the type of book: Machine finished coated papers, woodfree uncoated papers, coated fine papers and special fine papers are common paper grades.\nToday, the majority of books are printed by offset lithography. When a book is printed, the pages are laid out on the plate so that after the printed sheet is folded the pages will be in the correct sequence. Books tend to be manufactured nowadays in a few standard sizes. The sizes of books are usually specified as \"trim size\": the size of the page after the sheet has been folded and trimmed. The standard sizes result from sheet sizes (therefore machine sizes) which became popular 200 or 300 years ago, and have come to dominate the industry. British conventions in this regard prevail throughout the English-speaking world, except for the US. The European book manufacturing industry works to a completely different set of standards.\n\n\n==== Printing ====\n\nSome books, particularly those with shorter runs (i.e. with fewer copies) will be printed on sheet-fed offset presses, but most books are now printed on web presses, which are fed by a continuous roll of paper, and can consequently print more copies in a shorter time. As the production line circulates, a complete \"book\" is collected together in one stack of pages, and another machine carries out the folding, pleating, and stitching of the pages into bundles of signatures (sections of pages) ready to go into the gathering line. The pages of a book are printed two at a time, not as one complete book. Excess numbers are printed to make up for any spoilage due to make-readies or test pages to assure final print quality.\nA make-ready is the preparatory work carried out by the pressmen to get the printing press up to the required quality of impression. Included in make-ready is the time taken to mount the plat", "e onto the machine, clean up any mess from the previous job, and get the press up to speed. As soon as the pressman decides that the printing is correct, all the make-ready sheets will be discarded, and the press will start making books. Similar make readies take place in the folding and binding areas, each involving spoilage of paper.\n\n\n===== Digital printing =====\nRecent developments in book manufacturing include the development of digital printing. Book pages are printed, in much the same way as an office copier works, using toner rather than ink. Each book is printed in one pass, not as separate signatures. Digital printing has permitted the manufacture of much smaller quantities than offset, in part because of the absence of make readies and of spoilage. Digital printing has opened up the possibility of print-on-demand, where no books are printed until after an order is received from a customer.\n\n\n==== Binding ====\nAfter the signatures are folded and gathered, they move into the bindery. In the middle of last century there were still many trade binders\u2014stand-alone binding companies which did no printing, specializing in binding alone. At that time, because of the dominance of letterpress printing, typesetting and printing took place in one location, and binding in a different factory. When type was all metal, a typical book's worth of type would be bulky, fragile and heavy. The less it was moved in this condition the better: so printing would be carried out in the same location as the typesetting. Printed sheets on the other hand could easily be moved. Now, because of increasing computerization of preparing a book for the printer, the typesetting part of the job has flowed upstream, where it is done either by separately contracting companies working for the publisher, by the publishers themselves, or even by the authors. Mergers in the book manufacturing industry mean that it is now unusual to find a bindery which is not also involved in book printing (and vice", " versa).\nIf the book is a hardback its path through the bindery will involve more points of activity than if it is a paperback. Unsewn binding is now increasingly common. The signatures of a book can also be held together by \"Smyth sewing\" using needles, \"McCain sewing\", using drilled holes often used in schoolbook binding, or \"notch binding\", where gashes about an inch long are made at intervals through the fold in the spine of each signature. The rest of the binding process is similar in all instances. Sewn and notch bound books can be bound as either hardbacks or paperbacks.\n\n\n==== Finishing ====\n\"Making cases\" happens off-line and prior to the book's arrival at the binding line. In the most basic case-making, two pieces of cardboard are placed onto a glued piece of cloth with a space between them into which is glued a thinner board cut to the width of the spine of the book. The overlapping edges of the cloth (about 5/8\" all round) are folded over the boards, and pressed down to adhere. After case-making the stack of cases will go to the foil stamping area for adding decorations and type.\n\n\n== Formats ==\n\nFor most of the history of book making, books have been shared as physical books. However, with changes of technologies and growing awareness of the needs of people who have reading disabilities, other formats such as audiobooks and digital books have gained traction in the book market place.\n\n\n=== Physical books ===\nHardcover books have a stiff binding. Paperback books have cheaper, flexible covers which tend to be less durable. An alternative to paperback is the glossy cover, otherwise known as a dust cover, found on magazines, and comic books. Spiral-bound books are bound by spirals made of metal or plastic. Examples of spiral-bound books include teachers' manuals and puzzle books (crosswords, sudoku).\nPublishers may produce low-cost, pre-publication copies known as galleys or 'bound proofs' for promotional purposes, such as generating reviews in advance of p", "ublication. Galleys are usually made as cheaply as possible, since they are not intended for sale.\n\n\n==== Size ====\n\n\n==== Dummy books ====\n\nDummy books (or faux books) are books that are designed to imitate a real book by appearance to deceive people, some books may be whole with empty pages, others may be hollow or in other cases, there may be a whole panel carved with spines which are then painted to look like books, titles of some books may also be fictitious.\nThere are many reasons to have dummy books on display such as; to allude visitors of the vast wealth of information in their possession and to inflate the owner's appearance of wealth, to conceal something, for shop displays or for decorative purposes.\nIn early 19th century at Gwrych Castle, North Wales, Lloyd Hesketh Bamford-Hesketh was known for his vast collection of books at his library, however, at the later part of that same century, the public became aware that parts of his library was a fabrication, dummy books were built and then locked behind glass doors to stop people from trying to access them, from this a proverb was born, \"Like Hesky's library, all outside\".\n\n\n=== Ebook ===\n\n\n=== Audiobook ===\n\n\n=== Accessibility formats ===\n\n\n== Content ==\n\nLibraries, bookstores, and collections commonly divide books into fiction and non-fiction, though other types exist beyond this. Other books, which remain unpublished or are primarily published as part of different business functions (such as phone directories) may not be sold by bookstores or collected by libraries. Manuscripts, logbooks and other records may be classified and stored differently by special collections or archives.\n\n\n=== Fiction ===\nMany of the books published today are \"fiction\", meaning that they contain invented material, and are creative literature. Other literary forms such as poetry are included in the broad category. Most fiction is additionally categorized by literary form and genre.\nThe novel is the most common form of fiction bo", "ok. Novels are stories that typically feature a plot, setting, themes and characters. Stories and narrative are not restricted to any topic; a novel can be whimsical, serious or controversial. The novel has had a tremendous impact on entertainment and publishing markets. A novella is a term sometimes used for fiction prose typically between 17,500 and 40,000 words, and a novelette between 7,500 and 17,500. A short story may be any length up to 10,000 words, but these word lengths vary.\nComic books or graphic novels are books in which the story is illustrated. The characters and narrators use speech or thought bubbles to express verbal language.\n\n\n=== Non-fiction ===\n\nNon-fiction books are in principle based on fact, on subjects such as history, politics, social and cultural issues, as well as autobiographies and memoirs. Nearly all academic literature is non-fiction. A reference book is a general type of non-fiction book which provides information as opposed to telling a story, essay, commentary, or otherwise supporting a point of view.\n\n\n==== References ====\n\nAn almanac is a very general reference book, usually one-volume, with lists of data and information on many topics. An encyclopedia is a book or set of books designed to have more in-depth articles on many topics. A book listing words, their etymology, meanings, and other information is called a dictionary. A book which is a collection of maps is an atlas. A more specific reference book with tables or lists of data and information about a certain topic, often intended for professional use, is often called a handbook. Books which try to list references and abstracts in a certain broad area may be called an index, such as Engineering Index, or abstracts such as chemical abstracts and biological abstracts.\n\n\n==== Technical ====\n\nBooks with technical information on how to do something or how to use some equipment are called instruction manuals. Other popular how-to books include cookbooks and home improvement book", "s.\n\n\n==== Educational ====\n\nStudents typically store and carry textbooks and schoolbooks for study purposes. Lap books are a learning tool created by students. Elementary school pupils often use workbooks, which are published with spaces or blanks to be filled by them for study or homework. In US higher education, it is common for a student to take an exam using a blue book.\n\n\n==== Religious ====\nHymnals are books with collections of musical hymns that can typically be found in churches. Prayerbooks or missals are books that contain written prayers and are commonly carried by monks, nuns, and other devoted followers or clergy.\n\n\n=== Children's books ===\n\n\n=== Unpublished ===\n\nThere is a large set of books that are made only to write private ideas, notes, and accounts. These books are rarely published and are typically destroyed or remain private. Notebooks are blank papers to be written in by the user. Students and writers commonly use them for taking notes. Scientists and other researchers use lab notebooks to record their notes. They often feature spiral coil bindings at the edge so that pages may easily be torn out.\n\n\n=== Directories and record keeping ===\n\nAddress books, phone books, and calendar/appointment books are commonly used on a daily basis for recording appointments, meetings and personal contact information.\nBooks for recording periodic entries by the user, such as daily information about a journey, are called logbooks or logs. A similar book for writing the owner's daily private personal events, information, and ideas is called a diary or personal journal. Businesses use accounting books such as journals and ledgers to record financial data in a practice called bookkeeping (now usually held on computers rather than in hand-written form).\n\n\n== Collection and classification ==\nSince the beginning of creation of books, there has been need to create strategies for organizing, collecting and creating access to the books. Personal and public libraries, arch", "ives and other forms of collecting has led to different strategies for organizing, and subsequently making access to the books easier for different use cases.\nIn the 19th and 20th century, libraries and library professionals systematized book collecting and classification systems to respond to the growing literacy and print industries around the world. The most widely used system is ISBN, which has provided unique identifiers for books since 1970.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nPrivate or personal libraries made up of non-fiction and fiction books, as opposed to state or institutional archives, first appeared in classical Greece. In the ancient world, the maintaining of a library was usually (but not exclusively) the privilege of a wealthy individual. These libraries could have been either private or public, i.e. for people who were interested in using them. The difference from a modern public library lies in that they were usually not funded from public sources. It is estimated that in the city of Rome at the end of the 3rd century there were around 30 public libraries. Public libraries also existed in other cities of the ancient Mediterranean region (for example, Library of Alexandria). Later, in the Middle Ages, monasteries and universities also had libraries that could be accessible to the general public. Typically not the whole collection was available to the public; the books could not be borrowed and often were chained to reading stands to prevent theft.\nThe beginning of the modern public library begins around 15th century when individuals started to donate books to towns. The growth of a public library system in the United States started in the late 19th century and was much helped by donations from Andrew Carnegie. This reflected classes in a society: the poor or the middle class had to access most books through a public library or by other means, while the rich could afford to have a private library built in their homes. In the United States the Boston Public Librar", "y 1852 Report of the Trustees established the justification for the public library as a tax-supported institution intended to extend educational opportunity and provide for general culture.\nThe advent of paperback books in the 20th century led to an explosion of popular publishing. Paperback books made owning books affordable for many people. Paperback books often included works from genres that had previously been published mostly in pulp magazines. As a result of the low cost of such books and the spread of bookstores filled with them (in addition to the creation of a smaller market of extremely cheap used paperbacks), owning a private library ceased to be a status symbol for the rich.\nThe development of libraries has prompted innovations to help store and organize books on shelves. In library and booksellers' catalogues, it is common to include an abbreviation such as \"Crown 8vo\" to indicate the paper size from which the book is made. When rows of books are lined on a book holder, bookends are sometimes needed to keep them from slanting.\n\n\n=== Identification and classification ===\n\nDuring the 20th century, librarians were concerned about keeping track of the many books being added yearly to the Gutenberg Galaxy. Through a global society called the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA), they devised a series of tools including the International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD). Each book is specified by an International Standard Book Number, or ISBN, which is meant to be unique to every edition of every book produced by participating publishers, worldwide. It is managed by the ISBN Society. An ISBN has four parts: the first part is the country code, the second the publisher code, and the third the title code. The last part is a check digit, and can take values from 0\u20139 and X (10). The EAN Barcodes numbers for books are derived from the ISBN by prefixing 978, for Bookland, and calculating a new check digit.\nCommercial pub", "lishers in industrialized countries generally assign ISBNs to their books, so buyers may presume that the ISBN is part of a total international system, with no exceptions. However, many government publishers, in industrial as well as developing countries, do not participate fully in the ISBN system, and publish books which do not have ISBNs. A large or public collection requires a catalogue. Codes called \"call numbers\" relate the books to the catalogue, and determine their locations on the shelves. Call numbers are based on a Library classification system. The call number is placed on the spine of the book, normally a short distance before the bottom, and inside. Institutional or national standards, such as ANSI/NISO Z39.41 \u2013 1997, establish the correct way to place information (such as the title, or the name of the author) on book spines, and on \"shelvable\" book-like objects, such as containers for DVDs, video tapes and software.\n\nOne of the earliest and most widely known systems of cataloguing books is the Dewey Decimal System. Another widely known system is the Library of Congress Classification system. Both systems are biased towards subjects which were well represented in US libraries when they were developed, and hence have problems handling new subjects, such as computing, or subjects relating to other cultures. Information about books and authors can be stored in databases like online general-interest book databases. Metadata, which means \"data about data\" is information about a book. Metadata about a book may include its title, ISBN or other classification number (see above), the names of contributors (author, editor, illustrator) and publisher, its date and size, the language of the text, its subject matter, etc.\n\n\n==== Classification systems ====\nBliss bibliographic classification (BC)\nChinese Library Classification (CLC)\nColon Classification\nDewey Decimal Classification (DDC)\nHarvard-Yenching Classification\nLibrary of Congress Classification (LCC)\nNew Cl", "assification Scheme for Chinese Libraries\nUniversal Decimal Classification (UDC)\n\n\n=== Conservation ===\n\n\n== Social and cultural issues ==\n\n\n=== Reception ===\n\nThe impact of books can be various, and record of that reception comes in several formats: starting with initial public reception in contemporary newspapers, pop culture and correspondence, and then developing over time with different forms of literary criticism by professional and academic critics.

It was co-founded in 1935 by Allen Lane with his brothers Richard and John, as a line of the publishers The Bodley Head, only becoming a separate company the following year. Penguin revolutionised publishing in the 1930s through its inexpensive paperbacks, sold through Woolworths and other stores for sixpence, bringing high-quality fiction and non-fiction to the mass market. Its success showed that large audiences existed for serious books. It also affected modern British popular culture significantly through its books concerning politics, the arts, and science.\nPenguin Books is now an imprint of the worldwide Penguin Random House, a conglomerate formed in 2013 by its merger with American publisher Random House, a subsidiary of German media conglomerate Bertelsmann. Formerly, Penguin Group was wholly owned by British Pearson plc, the global media company which also owned the Financial Times. When Penguin Random House was formed, Pearson had a 47% stake in the new company, which was reduced to 25% in July 2017. Since April 2020, Penguin Random House has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Bertelsmann. It is one of the largest English-language publishers known as the Big Five, along with Holtzbrinck/Macmillan, Hachette, HarperCollins and Simon & Schuster.\nPenguin Books has its registered office in the City of Westminster, London, England.\n\n\n== Origins ==\n\nThe first Penguin paperbacks were published in 1935, but at first only as an imprint of The Bodley Head (of Vigo Street, London) with the books originally distributed from the crypt of Holy Trinity Church Marylebone.\nAnecdotally, Lane recounted how it was his experience with the poor quality of reading material on offer at Exeter railway station that inspired him to create cheap, well designed quality books for the mass market. The question of how publishers could reach a larger public had been the subject of a conference at Rippon Hall, Oxford, in 1934 which Lane ha", "d attended. Though the publication of literature in paperback was then associated mainly with poor quality lurid fiction, the Penguin brand owed something to the short-lived Albatross imprint of British and American reprints that briefly traded in 1932.\nInexpensive paperbacks did not initially appear viable to Bodley Head, since the deliberately low price of 6d. made profitability seem unlikely. This helped Lane purchase publication rights for some works more cheaply than he otherwise might have, since publishers were convinced of the business's short-term prospects. In the face of resistance from the traditional book trade, it was the purchase of 63,000 books by Woolworths Group that paid for the project outright, confirmed its worth, and allowed Lane to establish Penguin as a separate business in 1936. By March 1936, ten months after the company's launch on 30 July 1935, one million Penguin books had been printed.\nOnly paperback editions were published until the King Penguin series debuted in 1939, and latterly the Pelican History of Art was undertaken; these works, considered unsuitable as paperbacks because of their lengths and copious illustrations on art paper, were cloth-bound.\nPenguin Books Inc was incorporated in 1939 to satisfy US copyright law; and, despite being a late entrant into an already well established paperback market, enjoyed further success under vice president Kurt Enoch with such titles as What Plane Is That and The New Soldier Handbook.\nThe company's expansion saw the hiring of Eunice Frost\u2014first as a secretary, then as an editor, and ultimately as a director, who was to have a pivotal influence in shaping the company. In 1945 she was entrusted with the reconstruction of Penguin Inc after the departure of its first managing director, Ian Ballantine.\nFrom the outset, design was essential to Penguin's success. Avoiding the illustrated gaudiness of other paperback publishers, Penguin opted for the simple appearance of three horizontal bands, th", "e upper and lower of which were colour-coded according to the series to which the title belonged; this is sometimes referred to as the horizontal grid. In the central white panel, the author and title were printed in Gill Sans, and in the upper band was a cartouche with the legend \"Penguin Books\". The initial design was created by then 21-year-old office junior Edward Young, who also drew the first version of the Penguin logo. Series such as Penguin Specials and The Penguin Shakespeare had individual designs (by 1937, only S1 and B1-B18 had been published).\nThe colour schemes included: orange and white for general fiction, green and white for crime fiction, cerise and white for travel and adventure, dark blue and white for biographies, yellow and white for miscellaneous, red and white for drama; and the rarer purple and white for essays and belles lettres and grey and white for world affairs. Lane actively resisted the introduction of cover images for several years. Some recent publications of literature from that time have duplicated the original look.\nIn 1937, Penguin's headquarters were established at Harmondsworth, Middlesex (now part of Greater London).\n\n\n== War years ==\n\nThe Second World War saw Penguin emerge as a national institution. Though it had no formal role in the war effort, it was integral to it thanks to the publication of such bestselling manuals as Keeping Poultry and Rabbits on Scraps and Aircraft Recognition, and supplying books for the services and British POWs. In the war's six years, it printed some 600 titles and started 19 new series. At a time of enormous increase in the demand for books, Penguin enjoyed a privileged place among its peers.\nPaper rationing was the besetting problem of publishers in wartime, with the fall of France cutting off supply of esparto grass, one of the constituents of the pulp Penguin used. When rationing was introduced in March 1940, the Ministry of Supply allocated a quota to each publisher as a percentage of the", " amount that firm used between August 1938 and August 1939. This was particularly advantageous to Penguin, who, as a volume printer, was very successful that year. Further, in a deal with the Canadian Government, Penguin agreed to exclusively publish editions for their armed forces, for which they were paid in tons of paper.\nBy January 1942 the Book Production War Economy Agreement regulations came into force which determined rules on paper quality, type size and margins. Consequently, Penguin eliminated dust jackets, trimmed margins and replaced sewn bindings with metal staples. Aside from the noticeable deterioration in paperbacks' appearance, it became a practical impossibility to publish books of more than 256 pages, resulting in some titles falling out of print for want of material. In addition to their paper allocation, in 1941 Penguin secured a deal with the War Office, through Bill William's connections with ABCA and CEMA, to supply the troops with books through what was known as the Forces Book Club. Penguin received 60 tons a month from Paper Supply in return for 10 titles a month in runs of 75,000 at 5d.\nOriginally, every paperback carried the message, \"FOR THE FORCES \u2013 Leave this book at a Post Office when you have read it, so that men and women in the Services may enjoy it too\" at the bottom of the back cover, inviting the reader to take advantage of the Royal Mail's free transmission of books to the forces. However, demand exceeded supply on the home front, leading Lane to seek a monopoly on army books made specifically for overseas distribution. Their established paper supply put Penguin in an especially strong position after the war as rationing continued. For this reason, and for the popular prestige the company enjoyed, many of Penguin's competitors had no choice but to concede paperback reprint rights to it.\n\n\n== Post-war history ==\nIn 1945, Penguin began what would become one of its most important branches, the Penguin Classics, with a translatio", "n of Homer's Odyssey by E. V. Rieu. Between 1947 and 1949, the German typographer Jan Tschichold redesigned 500 Penguin books, and left Penguin with a set of influential rules of design principles brought together as the Penguin Composition Rules, a four-page booklet of typographic instructions for editors and compositors. Tschichold's work included the woodcut illustrated covers of the classics series (also known as the medallion series), and with Hans Schmoller, his eventual successor at Penguin, the vertical grid covers that became the standard for Penguin fiction throughout the 1950s. By this time the paperback industry in the UK had begun to grow, and Penguin found itself in competition with then fledgeling Pan Books. Many other series were published such as the Buildings of England, the Pelican History of Art and Penguin Education.\nIn 1949, Harry F. Paroissien (who had been Sir Allen Lane's deputy) was sent by him to the United States to set up Penguin Books in Baltimore, Maryland.\nBy 1960, a number of forces were to shape the direction of the company, the publication list and its graphic design. On 20 April 1961, Penguin became a publicly listed company on the London Stock Exchange; consequently, Allen Lane had a diminished role at the firm though he was to continue as managing director. New techniques such as phototypesetting and offset-litho printing were to replace hot metal and letterpress printing, dramatically reducing cost and permitting the printing of images and text on the same paper stock, thus paving the way for the introduction of photography and novel approaches to graphic design on paperback covers. In May 1960, Tony Godwin was appointed as editorial adviser, rapidly rising to Chief Editor from which position he sought to broaden the range of Penguin's list and keep up with new developments in graphic design. To this end, he hired Germano Facetti in January 1961, who was to decisively alter the appearance of the Penguin brand. Beginning with th", "e crime series, Facetti canvassed the opinion of a number of designers including Romek Marber for a new look to the Penguin cover. It was Marber's suggestion of what came to be called the Marber grid along with the retention of traditional Penguin colour-coding that was to replace the previous three horizontal bars design and set the pattern for the design of the company's paperbacks for the next twenty years. Facetti rolled out the new treatment across the Penguin line starting with crime, the orange fiction series, then Pelicans, Penguin Modern Classics, Penguin Specials, and Penguin Classics, giving an overall visual unity to the company's list. A somewhat different approach was taken to the Peregrine, Penguin Poets, Penguin Modern Poets, and Penguin Plays series. There were over a hundred different series published in total.\nJust as Lane well judged the public's appetite for paperbacks in the 1930s, his decision to publish Lady Chatterley's Lover by D. H. Lawrence in 1960 boosted Penguin's notoriety. The novel was at the time unpublished in the United Kingdom and the predicted obscenity trial, R v Penguin Books Ltd, not only marked Penguin as a fearless publisher, it also helped drive the sale of at least 3.5 million copies. Penguin's victory in the case heralded the end to the censorship of books in the UK, although censorship of the written word was only finally defeated after the Inside Linda Lovelace trial of 1978.\n\n\n=== Pearson takeover ===\n\nBy the end of the 1960s Penguin was in financial trouble, and several proposals were made for a new operating structure. These included ownership by a consortium of universities, or joint ownership by the Cambridge University Press and Oxford University Press, but none of them came to anything. Sir Allen Lane died on 7 July, and six weeks later, Penguin was acquired by Pearson PLC on 21 August 1970. A new emphasis on profitability emerged and, with the departure of Facetti in 1972, the defining era of Penguin book desig", "n came to an end.\nPenguin merged with long-established U.S. publisher Viking Press in 1975.\nThe first Penguin Bookshop opened in Covent Garden in 1980.\nIn 1985, Penguin purchased British hardback publisher Michael Joseph and in 1986, Hamish Hamilton. After these acquisitions, Penguin moved its offices to central London (27 Wrights Lane, W8 5TZ). Thus 'Harmondsworth' disappeared as the place of publication after half a century. (The warehouse at Harmondsworth would remain in operation until 2004.)\nAlso in 1986, Penguin purchased American publisher New American Library (NAL) and its hard-cover affiliate E. P. Dutton. New American Library had originally been Penguin U.S.A. and had been spun off in 1948 because of the high complexity of import and export regulations. Penguin repurchased it in order to extend its reach into the US market, and NAL saw the move as a way to gain a hold in international markets.\nPenguin published Deborah Lipstadt's book Denying the Holocaust, which accused David Irving of Holocaust denial. Irving sued Lipstadt and Penguin for libel in 1998 but lost in a much publicised court case. Other titles published by Penguin which gained media attention, and controversy, include Massacre by Sin\u00e9, Spycatcher, which was suppressed in the UK by the government for a time, and The Satanic Verses, leading to its author Salman Rushdie having to go into hiding for some years after Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran issued a Fatw\u0101, an edict amounting to a sentence of death against him.\nIn 2006, Penguin attempted to involve the public in collaboratively writing a novel on a wiki platform. They named this project A Million Penguins. On 7 March 2007, the Penguin Books UK blog announced that the project had come to an end.\nIn 2014, the Penguin Hotline was created by Madeline McIntosh. An orange commemorative plaque was unveiled at Exeter train station in May 2017 to mark Lane's significant contribution to the publishing industry.\n\n\n== Imprints and series ==\n\n\n=== Penguin C", "lassics ===\n\nConsonant with Penguin's corporate mission to bring canonical literature to the mass market, the company first ventured into publishing the classics in May 1938 with the issue of Penguin Illustrated Classics. The savings from the author's payments on these royalty-free titles were instead invested in commissioning wood-engravings from Robert Gibbings and his circle emanating from the Central School of Arts and Crafts. The books were distinct from the rest of the Penguin marque in their use of a vertical grid (anticipating Tschichold's innovation of 1951) and albertus typeface. The series was not a financial success and the list ceased after just ten volumes the same year it began. Penguin returned to classics with the printing of E. V. Rieu's translation of Homer's Odyssey in 1946, which went on to sell three million copies.\nPenguin's commercial motivation was, as ever, populist; rendering the classics in an approachable modern English was therefore a difficult task whose execution did not always satisfy the critics. Rieu said of his work that \"I have done my best to make Homer easy reading for those who are unfamiliar with the Greek world.\" He was joined in 1959 by Betty Radice who was first his assistant then, after his retirement in 1964, she assumed the role of joint editor with Robert Baldick. As the publisher's focus changed from the needs of the marketplace to those of the classroom the criticism became more acute, Thomas Gould wrote of the series \"most of the philosophical volumes in the Penguin series are bad \u2013 some very bad indeed. Since Plato and Aristotle are the most read philosophers in the world today, and since some of these Penguin translations are favourites among professional philosophers in several countries, this amounts to a minor crisis in the history of philosophy.\"\nThe imprint publishes hundreds of classics from the Greeks and Romans to Victorian Literature to modern classics. For nearly twenty years, variously coloured borders ", "to the front and back covers indicated the original language. The second period of design meant largely black covers with a colour illustration on the front. In 2002, Penguin announced it was redesigning its entire catalogue, merging the original Classics list (known in the trade as \"Black Classics\") with what had been the old Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics list, though the silver covers for the latter have so far been retained for most of the titles. Previously this line had been called 'Penguin Modern Classics' with a pale green livery.\nThe redesign \u2013 featuring a colourful painting on the cover, with black background and orange lettering \u2013 was well received. However, the quality of the paperbacks themselves seemed to decrease: the spines were more likely to fold and bend. The paperbacks are also printed on non-acid-free pulp paper, which, by some accounts, tends to yellow and brown within a couple of years.\nThe text page design was also overhauled to follow a more closely prescribed template, allowing for faster copyediting and typesetting, but reducing the options for individual design variations suggested by a text's structure or historical context (for example, in the choice of text typeface). Prior to 2002, the text page typography of each book in the Classics series had been overseen by a team of in-house designers; this department was drastically reduced in 2003 as part of the production costs. The in-house text design department still exists, albeit much smaller than formerly. Recent design work includes the Penguin Little Black Classic series, designed by Claire Mason.\n\n\n=== Pelican Books ===\n\nLane expanded the business in 1937 with the publication of George Bernard Shaw's The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism under the Pelican Books imprint, an imprint designed to educate the reading public rather than entertain. Recognising his own limitations Lane appointed V. K. Krishna Menon as the first commissioning editor of the series, supp", "orted by an advisory panel consisting of Peter Chalmers Mitchell, H. L. Bales and W. E. Williams. Several thousand Pelicans were published over the next half-century and brought high quality accounts of the current state of knowledge in many fields, often written by authors of specialised academic books. (The Pelican series, in decline for several years, was finally discontinued in 1984.)\nAircraft Recognition (S82) by R. A. Saville-Sneath, was a bestseller. In 1940, the children's imprint Puffin Books began with a series of non-fiction picture books; the first work of children's fiction published under the imprint was Barbara Euphan Todd's Worzel Gummidge the following year. Another series that began in wartime was the Penguin Poets: the first volume was a selection of Tennyson's poems (D1) in 1941. Later examples are The Penguin Book of Modern American Verse (D22), 1954, and The Penguin Book of Restoration Verse (D108), 1968. J. M. Cohen's Comic and Curious Verse appeared in three volumes over a number of years.\nPelican Books was relaunched as a digital imprint in 2014, with four books published simultaneously on 1 May: Economics: A User's Guide by Ha-Joon Chang, The Domesticated Brain by the psychologist Bruce Hood, Revolutionary Russia by Orlando Figes and Human Evolution by the anthropologist Robin Dunbar.\n\n\n=== Penguin Education ===\n\nIn 1965 Penguin entered the field of educational publishing, Allen Lane's aim being to carry the radical and populist spirit of Pelicans into the schoolbook market. His final major initiative, the division was established as a separate publishing operation from Harmondsworth, and based in West Drayton in Middlesex. During its nine-year life it had a major impact on school books, breaking new ground in their concept and design and strongly influencing other publishers' lists.\nAmong the most successful and influential series were Voices and Junior Voices, Connexions, and the Penguin English Project. Alongside these and other series, ", "the imprint continued another Penguin tradition by producing Education Specials, titles which focussed on often controversial topics within education and beyond. They included highly topical books such as The Hornsey Affair and Warwick University Ltd, reflecting the student unrest of the late 1960s and contributing to the intense national debate about the purpose of higher education. Other titles featured the radical and influential ideas about schooling propounded by writers and teachers from America and elsewhere.\nPenguin Education also published an extensive range of Readers and introductory texts for students in higher education, notably in subjects such as psychology, economics, management, sociology and science, while for teachers it provided a series of key texts such as Language, the Learner and the School and The Language of Primary School Children. Following Allen Lane's death in 1970 and the takeover the same year by Pearson Longman, the division discontinued publishing school books and was closed in March 1974. More than 80 teachers, educational journalists and academics signed a letter to the Times Educational Supplement regretting the closure of the influential imprint.\n\n\n=== Penguin Specials ===\nIn November 1937, Penguin inaugurated a new series of short, polemical books under the rubric of Penguin Specials with the publication of Edgar Mowrer's Germany Puts the Clock Back. Their purpose was to offer in-depth analysis of current affairs that would counter the perceived bias of the newspapers in addition to being the company's response to the popularity of Gollancz's Left Book Club. Whereas the Left Book Club was avowedly pro-Soviet, Penguin and Lane expressed no political preference as their editorial policy, though the widespread belief was that the series was left-leaning since the editor was the communist John Lehmann and its authors were, with a few exceptions, men of the left. Speed of publication and delivery (a turnaround of weeks rather than m", "onths) were essential to the topicality and therefore success of the Specials, Genevieve Tabouis's anti-appeasement tract Blackmail or War sold over 200,000 copies for example. However even this immediacy did not prevent them being overtaken by events: Shiela Grant Duff's Europe and the Czechs only made it onto the bookstands on the day of the Munich agreement, but nevertheless went on to be a bestseller. Thirty-five Penguin Specials were published before the outbreak of war, including two novels Ha\u0161ek's Good Soldier Schweik and Bottome's The Mortal Storm; they collectively made a significant contribution to the public debate of the time, with many of the more controversial titles being the subject of leading articles in the press.\nAfter a hiatus between 1945 and 1949, the Penguin Specials continued after the war under the editorship of first Tom Maschler, then after 1961 Tony Godwin. The first title in the revived series was William Gallacher's The Case for Communism. Godwin initiated the \"What's Wrong with Britain\" series of Specials in the run up to the 1964 election, which constituted a platform for the New Left's brand of cultural analysis that characterised the leftist political radicalism of the 1960s. Indeed, Penguin Books contributed to the funds that set up Richard Hoggart and Stuart Hall's Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at Birmingham University in 1964. This brief period of revival for Penguin Specials in contributing to the national dialogue was not sustained after the departure of Godwin in 1967, and with the rise in television journalism the Specials series declined in significance through the 1970s and 1980s. The last Special was published in 1988 with Keith Thompson's Under Siege: Racism and Violence in Britain Today.\nIn December 2011, Penguin launched nine titles as 'Penguin Shorts' which featured the iconic tri-band covers. These books were novellas and short length works of fiction and/or memoirs. In 2012 they became known as Penguin Spe", "cials following an agreement with The Economist made in March of that year. These works focused on the kind of topical journalism that was a feature of the original Penguin Specials. Subsequent Penguin Specials released in 2012 and 2013 continued to include both fiction, including the publication of the works shortlisted for the Monash Undergraduate Prize 2012, and topical journalism. Collected columns of cultural critics were also featured.\n\n\n=== Puffin ===\n\nNoel Carrington, an editor at Country Life magazine, first approached Lane with the idea of publishing low-cost, illustrated non-fiction children's books in 1938. Inspired by the Editions P\u00e8re Castor books drawn by Rojan and the technique of autolithography used in the poster art of the time, Carrington's suggestion for what was to become the Puffin Picture Book series was adopted by Penguin in 1940 when, as Lane saw it, evacuated city children would need books on farming and natural history to help adjust to the country. The first four titles appeared in December 1940; War on Land, War at Sea, War in the Air and On the Farm, and a further nine the following year. Despite Lane's intention to publish twelve a year paper and staff shortages meant only thirteen were issued in the first two years of the series. The Picture Books' 120 titles resulted in 260 variants altogether, the last number 116 Paxton Chadwick's Life Histories, was issued hors s\u00e9rie in 1996 by the Penguin Collector's Society.\nInexpensive paperback children's fiction did not exist at the time Penguin sought to expand their list into this new market. To this end Eleanor Graham was appointed in 1941 as the first editor of the Puffin Story Books series, a venture made particularly difficult due to the resistance of publishers and librarians in releasing the rights of their children's books. The first five titles (Worzel Gummidge, Cornish Adventure, The Cuckoo Clock, Garram the Hunter and Smokey) were published in the three horizontal stripes company ", "livery of the rest of the Penguin output, a practice abandoned after the ninth volume when full-bleed colour illustrated covers were introduced, a fact that heralded the much greater design freedom of the Puffin series over the rest of Penguin's books.\nGraham retired in 1961 and was replaced by Kaye Webb who presided over the department for 18 years in a period that saw greatly increased competition in the children's market as well as a greater sophistication in production and marketing. One innovation of Webb's was the creation of the Puffin Club in 1967 and its quarterly magazine Puffin Post, which at its height had 200,000 members. The Puffin authors' list added Arthur Ransome, Roald Dahl and Ursula K. Le Guin during Webb's editorship and saw the creation of the Peacock series of teenage fiction.\nTony Lacey took over Webb's editorial chair in 1979 at the invitation of Penguin managing director Peter Mayer when Puffin was one of the few profitable divisions of the beleaguered company. In line with Mayer's policy of more aggressive commercialisation of the Penguin brand Lacey reduced the number of Puffin imprints, consolidated popular titles under the Puffin Classics rubric and inaugurated the successful interactive gamebook series Fighting Fantasy. Complementary to the Puffin Club the Puffin School Book Club, addressed specifically to schools and organisations, grew significantly in this period helping to confirm Puffin market position such that by 1983 one in three Penguin books sold was a Puffin.\n\n\n=== The Buildings of England ===\n\nNikolaus Pevsner first proposed a series of volumes amounting to a county by county survey of the monuments of England in ten or more books to both the Cambridge University Press and Routledge before the war, however for various reason his plan came to nothing. It was only through his involvement with Penguin that he was in a position to make a similar suggestion to Allen Lane and be accepted. Pevsner described the project of the Buil", "dings of England as an attempt to fill the gap in English publishing for those multi-volume survey of national art familiar on the continent. In particular Georg Dehio's Handbuch der deutschen Kunstdenkmaler, a topographical inventory of Germany's important historic buildings that was published in five volumes between 1905 and 1912. Though Pevsner's ambition for the series was to educate and inform the general public on the subtleties of English architectural history, the immediate commercial imperative was competition with the Shell Guides edited by John Betjeman of which 13 had been published by 1939. With Lane's agreement in 1945 Pevsner began work personally touring the county that was to be the subject of observation aided by notes drawn up by researchers. The first volume, Cornwall, appeared in 1951, and went on to produce 46 architectural guidebooks between then and 1974 of which he wrote 32 alone and ten with assistance. As early as 1954 the series was in commercial difficulty and required sponsorship to continue, a grant from the Leverhulme Trust amongst other sources secured its completion. The series continued after Pevsner's death in 1983, financed in part by the Pevsner Books Trust and published by Yale University Press.\nPevsner's approach was of Kunstgeschichte quite distinct from the antiquarian interest of local and family history typical of English county histories. Consequently, there is little mention of monumental brasses, bells, tracery, the relationship of the building to the landscape. Nor is there much discussion on building techniques, nor industrial architecture, nor on Art Deco buildings, omissions that his critics hold have led to those subjects undervaluation and neglect. Nevertheless, Pevsner's synoptic study brought rigorous architectural history to an appreciative mass audience, and in particular he enlarged the perception of the Victorian achievement in architecture.\n\n\n=== Magazine publishing ===\nWartime paper rationing, which had re", "sulted in a generous allocation to Penguin, also forced the reduction in space for book reviews and advertising in the newspapers and was partly the cause of the folding of several literary journals, consequently left a gap in the magazine market that Lane hoped to fill. In January 1941 the first issue of Penguin New Writing appeared and instantly dominated the market with 80,000 copies sold compared to its closest rival, Cyril Connolly's Horizon, which mustered 3,500 sales in its first edition. Penguin New Writing's editor John Lehmann was instrumental in introducing the British public to such new writers as Lawrence Durrell, Saul Bellow and James Michie. Yet despite popular and critical success further rationing and, after 1945 declining sales, led monthly publication to become quarterly until the journal finally closed in autumn 1950 after 40 issues.\nThough New Writing was the most durable of Penguin's periodicals it wasn't the publisher's only foray into journalism with Russian Review, Penguin Hansard and Transatlantic begun during the war, and Penguin Film Review, Penguin Music Magazine, New Biology (1945\u20131960), Penguin Parade, Penguin Science Survey and Penguin Science News having brief runs after 1945.\nAs of the 2020s, the publication The Happy Reader retails in Europe.\n\n\n=== Popular Penguins ===\nPenguin's Australian subsidiary released the Popular Penguins series late in 2008. The series has its own website. It was intended to include 50 titles, many of which duplicate those on the Penguin Celebrations list but this was reduced to 49 titles as one of the 50, Hegemony or Survival by Noam Chomsky, had to be withdrawn after its initial release as Penguin discovered they no longer held the rights to it.\nPopular Penguins are presented as a return to Lane's original ethos \u2013 good books at affordable prices. They have been published with a cover price of A$9.95, less than half of the average price of a paperback novel in Australia at the time of release.\nPopular Pen", "guins are presented in a more \"authentic\" interpretation of the Penguin Grid than that of the Celebrations series. They are correct size, when compared to an original 'grid-era' Penguin, and they use Eric Gill's typefaces in a more or less exact match for Jan Tschichold's \"tidying\" of Edward Young's original three panel cover design. The covers are also printed on a card stock that mirrors the look and feel of 1940s and 50s Penguin covers. On the other hand, all of the Popular Penguins series are in Penguin Orange, and not colour-coded in the manner of the original designs and the \"Celebrations\" titles.\nIn July 2009, another 50 Popular Penguins were released onto the Australian and New Zealand markets. A further 10 titles written by New Zealand authors were released in March 2010. Another 75 titles were released in Australia in July 2010 to mark Penguin's 75th anniversary.\n\n\n=== King Penguin Books ===\nKing Penguin Books was a series of pocket-sized monographs published by Penguin Books between 1939 and 1959. They were in imitation of the Insel-B\u00fccherei series published in Germany by Insel Verlag from 1912 onwards, and were pioneer volumes for Penguins in that they were their first volumes with hard covers and their first with colour printing.\nThe books originally combined a classic series of colour plates with an authoritative text. The first two volumes featured sixteen plates from John Gould's The Birds of Great Britain (1873) with historical introduction and commentary on each plate by Phyllis Barclay-Smith, and sixteen plates from Redout\u00e9's Roses (1817\u201324) with historical introduction and commentary by John Ramsbottom. The third volume began the alternative practice of colour plates from a variety of sources.\nSome of the volumes, such as Nikolaus Pevsner's Leaves of Southwell (1945) or Wilfrid Blunt's Tulipomania (1950) were pioneering works of scholarship. Others such as The Bayeux Tapestry by Eric Maclagan (1943), Ur : The First Phases by Leonard Woolley (1946", ") or Russian Icons (1947) by David Talbot Rice were distillations by experts of their own pioneering works. Some volumes by experts went into revised editions, such as A Book of English Clocks (1947 and 1950) by R. W. Symonds.\nElizabeth Senior edited the series until 1941, after which Nikolaus Pevsner took over and remained editor until the end of the series. The series ran to 76 volumes.\nThe King Penguin imprint was briefly revived in 1981 for a series of contemporary works, chiefly fiction.\n\n\n=== Pelican History of Art ===\nAllen Lane approached Nikolaus Pevsner in 1945 for a series of illustrated books that would match the success of the King Penguins. Pevsner recalled his response: \"Allen said, 'You have done the King Penguins now and we are going on with them, but if you had your way, what else would you do?' I had my answer ready\u2014and the answer was very formidable, because I outlined both The Pelican History of Art and The Buildings of England on the spot, each about 40 to 50 volumes. Allen said, 'Yes, we can do both,' and that was the end of the meeting.\" Pevsner's industry quickly bore fruit with the first contracts signed by 1946 for John Summerson's Architecture in Britain, Anthony Blunt's Art and Architecture in France, and Rudolf Wittkower's Italian art and architecture, the first title Painting in Britain, 1530\u20131790 by Ellis Waterhouse was issued in 1953. By 1955, Pevsner produced a prospectus for the series announcing the publication of four new volumes and a plan for the rest of the series totalling 47 titles. The ambition of the series exceeded previously published multi-volume histories of art such as Andr\u00e9 Michel's Histoire de l'art (17 vols., 1905\u201328), the Propyl\u00e4en Kunstgeschichte (25 vols., 1923\u201335). Forty-one volumes were published by the time Pevsner retired from editing in 1977. His work was continued by Judy Nairn (his editorial assistant on the Buildings of England) and the medievalist Peter Lasko. Yale University Press acquired the series i", "n 1992 when 45 titles had been completed; by 2004 they had published 21 volumes, mostly revisions of existing editions. New volumes continue to be produced in the 2010s, and new editions of older ones.\nFor Penguin the series was a departure from their commercial mainstay of paperbacks as the histories of art were the first large format, illustrated hardback books they had produced. Despite their relatively high price they were a financial success, yet for Pevsner they were intended primarily as graduate level texts in what was, for the English speaking world, the newly emerging academic discipline of art history. Nevertheless, the series was criticised from within the academy for its evident biases. Many of its authors were German \u00e9migr\u00e9s, consequently there was a methodological preference for the kunstwissenschaft practiced in Vienna and Berlin between the wars; a formalism that ignored the social context of art. Moreover, the weight given to some subjects seemed disproportionate to some critics, with seven of its 47 volumes dedicated to English art, a \"tributary of the main European current\" as the Burlington Magazine observed. Though the 1955 plan was never fully executed\u2014the volumes on Greek painting and sculpture, quattrocento painting and cinquecento sculpture were not written\u2014the Pelican History remains one of the most comprehensive surveys of world art published.\n\n\n=== Penguin on Wheels ===\nPenguin on Wheels is a mobile bookstore launched by Penguin Books India in collaboration with Satabdi Mishra and Akshaya Rautaray.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nWilliams, Richard THE FIRST THOUSAND PENGUINS SEE https://archive.org/details/bpc-11-penguin-1000\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial websites\n\nPenguin Books USA\nPenguin Books UK\nPenguin Books Portugal\nOther\n\nPenguin Archive University of Bristol Library Special Collections\nPenguin Archive Project University of Bristol\nKing Penguin Book Series King Penguin Book Series\nThe Art ", "of Penguin Science Fiction The history and cover art of science fiction published by Penguin Books from 1935 to the present day\nPenguin First Editions Guide to the early (1935\u20131955) first editions published by Penguin Books\nPenguin book covers\nPenguin Cerise Travel Celebrating Penguin Books' early 'Travel and Adventure' series\nFoley Collection\u2014articles and extensive lists\nHistory of the Penguin Archive by Toby Clements, The Telegraph, 19 February 2009.\nArchival Material at\nPenguin Books, Penguin, and Penguin Books Ltd at Open Library", "Google Books (previously known as Google Book Search, Google Print, and by its code-name Project Ocean) is a service from Google that searches the full text of books and magazines that Google has scanned, converted to text using optical character recognition (OCR), and stored in its digital database. Books are provided either by publishers and authors through the Google Books Partner Program, or by Google's library partners through the Library Project. Additionally, Google has partnered with a number of magazine publishers to digitize their archives.\nThe Publisher Program was first known as Google Print when it was introduced at the Frankfurt Book Fair in October 2004. The Google Books Library Project, which scans works in the collections of library partners and adds them to the digital inventory, was announced in December 2004.\nThe Google Books initiative has been hailed for its potential to offer unprecedented access to what may become the largest online body of human knowledge and promoting the democratization of knowledge. However, it has also been criticized for potential copyright violations, and lack of editing to correct the many errors introduced into the scanned texts by the OCR process.\nAs of October 2019, Google celebrated 15 years of Google Books and provided the number of scanned books as more than 40 million titles.\nGoogle estimated in 2010 that there were about 130 million distinct titles in the world, and stated that it intended to scan all of them. However, the scanning process in American academic libraries has slowed since the 2000s. Google Book's scanning efforts have been subject to litigation, including Authors Guild v. Google, a class-action lawsuit in the United States, decided in Google's favor (see below). This was a major case that came close to changing copyright practices for orphan works in the United States. A 2023 study by scholars from the University of California, Berkeley and Northeastern University's business schools found that G", "oogle Books's digitization of books has led to increased sales for the physical versions of the books.\n\n\n== Details ==\nResults from Google Books show up in both the universal Google Search and in the dedicated Google Books search website (books.google.com).\nIn response to search queries, Google Books allows users to view full pages from books in which the search terms appear if the book is out of copyright or if the copyright owner has given permission. If Google believes the book is still under copyright, a user sees \"snippets\" of text around the queried search terms. All instances of the search terms in the book text appear with a yellow highlight.\nThe four access levels used on Google Books are:\n\nFull view: Books in the public domain are available for \"full view\" and can be downloaded for free. In-print books acquired through the Partner Program are also available for full view if the publisher has given permission, although this is rare.\nPreview: For in-print books where permission has been granted, the number of viewable pages is limited to a \"preview\" set by a variety of access restrictions and security measures, some based on user-tracking. Usually, the publisher can set the percentage of the book available for preview. Users are restricted from copying, downloading or printing book previews. A watermark reading \"Copyrighted material\" appears at the bottom of pages. All books acquired through the Partner Program are available for preview.\nSnippet view: A \"snippet view\" \u2013 two to three lines of text surrounding the queried search term \u2013 is displayed in cases where Google does not have permission of the copyright owner to display a preview. This could be because Google cannot identify the owner or the owner declined permission. If a search term appears many times in a book, Google displays no more than three snippets, thus preventing the user from viewing too much of the book. Also, Google does not display any snippets for certain reference books, such as dictio", "naries, where the display of even snippets can harm the market for the work. Google maintains that no permission is required under copyright law to display the snippet view.\nNo preview: Google also displays search results for books that have not been digitized. As these books have not been scanned, their text is not searchable and only the metadata such as the title, author, publisher, number of pages, ISBN, subject and copyright information, and in some cases, a table of contents and book summary is available. In effect, this is similar to an online library card catalog.\nIn response to criticism from groups such as the American Association of Publishers and the Authors Guild, Google announced an opt-out policy in August 2005, through which copyright owners could provide a list of titles that they do not want scanned, and the request would be respected. The company also stated that it would not scan any in-copyright books between August and 1 November 2005, to provide the owners with the opportunity to decide which books to exclude from the Project. Thus, copyright owners have three choices with respect to any work:\n\nIt can participate in the Partner Program to make a book available for preview or full view, in which case it would share revenue derived from the display of pages from the work in response to user queries.\nIt can let Google scan the book under the Library Project and display snippets in response to user queries.\nIt can opt out of the Library Project, in which case Google will not scan the book. If the book has already been scanned, Google will reset its access level as 'No preview'.\nMost scanned works are no longer in print or commercially available.\nIn addition to procuring books from libraries, Google also obtains books from its publisher partners, through the \"Partner Program\" \u2013 designed to help publishers and authors promote their books. Publishers and authors submit either a digital copy of their book in EPUB or PDF format, or a print copy to Goog", "le, which is made available on Google Books for preview. The publisher can control the percentage of the book available for preview, with the minimum being 20%. They can also choose to make the book fully viewable, and even allow users to download a PDF copy. Books can also be made available for sale on Google Play. Unlike the Library Project, this does not raise any copyright concerns as it is conducted pursuant to an agreement with the publisher. The publisher can choose to withdraw from the agreement at any time.\nFor many books, Google Books displays the original page numbers. However, Tim Parks, writing in The New York Review of Books in 2014, noted that Google had stopped providing page numbers for many recent publications (likely the ones acquired through the Partner Program) \"presumably in alliance with the publishers, in order to force those of us who need to prepare footnotes to buy paper editions.\"\n\n\n== Scanning of books ==\nThe project began in 2002 under the codename Project Ocean. Google co-founder Larry Page had always had an interest in digitizing books. When he and Marissa Mayer began experimenting with book scanning in 2002, it took 40 minutes for them to digitize a 300-page book. But soon after the technology had been developed to the extent that scanning operators could scan up to 6000 pages an hour.\nGoogle established designated scanning centers to which books were transported by trucks. The stations could digitize at the rate of 1,000 pages per hour. The books were placed in a custom-built mechanical cradle that adjusted the book spine in place while an array of lights and optical instruments scanned the two open pages. Each page would have two cameras directed at it capturing the image, while a range finder LIDAR overlaid a three-dimensional laser grid on the book's surface to capture the curvature of the paper. A human operator would turn the pages by hand, using a foot pedal to take the photographs. With no need to flatten the pages or align t", "hem perfectly, Google's system not only reached a remarkable efficiency and speed but also helped protect the fragile collections from being over-handled. Afterwards, the crude images went through three levels of processing: first, de-warping algorithms used the LIDAR data fix the pages' curvature. Then, optical character recognition (OCR) software transformed the raw images into text, and, lastly, another round of algorithms extracted page numbers, footnotes, illustrations and diagrams.\nMany of the books are scanned using a customized Elphel 323 camera at a rate of 1,000 pages per hour. A patent awarded to Google in 2009 revealed that Google had come up with an innovative system for scanning books that uses two cameras and infrared light to automatically correct for the curvature of pages in a book. By constructing a 3D model of each page and then \"de-warping\" it, Google is able to present flat-looking pages without having to really make the pages flat, which requires the use of destructive methods such as unbinding or glass plates to individually flatten each page, which is inefficient for large scale scanning.\nGoogle decided to omit color information in favour of better spatial resolution, as most out-of-copyright books at the time did not contain colors. Each page image was passed through algorithms that distinguished the text and illustration regions. Text regions were then processed via OCR to enable full-text searching. Google expended considerable resources in coming up with optimal compression techniques, aiming for high image quality while keeping the file sizes minimal to enable access by internet users with low bandwidth.\n\n\n== Website functionality ==\nFor each work, Google Books automatically generates an overview page. This page displays information extracted from the book\u2014its publishing details, a high frequency word map, the table of contents\u2014as well as secondary material, such as summaries, reader reviews (not readable in the mobile version of the we", "bsite), and links to other relevant texts. A visitor to the page, for instance, might see a list of books that share a similar genre and theme, or they might see a list of current scholarship on the book. This content, moreover, offers interactive possibilities for users signed into their Google account. They can export the bibliographic data and  citations in standard formats, write their own reviews, add it to their library to be tagged, organized, and shared with other people. Thus, Google Books collects these more interpretive elements from a range of sources, including the users, third-party sites like Goodreads, and often the book's author and publisher.\nIn fact, to encourage authors to upload their own books, Google has added several functionalities to the website. The authors can allow visitors to download their ebook for free, or they can set their own purchase price. They can change the price back and forth, offering discounts whenever it suits them. Also, if a book's author chooses to add an ISBN, LCCN or OCLC record number, the service will update the book's url to include it. Then, the author can set a specific page as the link's anchor. This option makes their book more easily discoverable.\n\n\n== Ngram Viewer ==\n\nThe Ngram Viewer is a service connected to Google Books that graphs the frequency of word usage across their book collection. The service is important for historians and linguists as it can provide an inside look into human culture through word use throughout time periods. This program has fallen under criticism because of errors in the metadata used in the program.\n\n\n== Content issues and criticism ==\nThe project has received criticism that its stated aim of preserving orphaned and out-of-print works is at risk due to scanned data having errors and such problems not being solved.\n\n\n=== Scanning errors ===\n\nThe scanning process is subject to errors. For example, some pages may be unreadable, upside down, or in the wrong order. Scholars have eve", "n reported crumpled pages, obscuring thumbs and fingers, and smeared or blurry images. On this issue, a declaration from Google at the end of scanned books says:\n\nThe digitization at the most basic level is based on page images of the physical books. To make this book available as an ePub formatted file we have taken those page images and extracted the text using Optical Character Recognition (or OCR for short) technology. The extraction of text from page images is a difficult engineering task. Smudges on the physical books' pages, fancy fonts, old fonts, torn pages, etc. can all lead to errors in the extracted text. Imperfect OCR is only the first challenge in the ultimate goal of moving from collections of page images to extracted-text based books. Our computer algorithms also have to automatically determine the structure of the book (what are the headers and footers, where images are placed, whether text is verse or prose, and so forth).\nGetting this right allows us to render the book in a way that follows the format of the original book. Despite our best efforts you may see spelling mistakes, garbage characters, extraneous images, or missing pages in this book. Based on our estimates, these errors should not prevent you from enjoying the content of the book. The technical challenges of automatically constructing a perfect book are daunting, but we continue to make enhancements to our OCR and book structure extraction technologies.\nIn 2009, Google stated that they would start using reCAPTCHA to help fix the errors found in Google Book scans. This method would only improve scanned words that are hard to recognize because of the scanning process and cannot solve errors such as turned pages or blocked words.\nScanning errors have inspired works of art such as published collections of anomalous pages and a Tumblr blog.\n\n\n=== Errors in metadata ===\nScholars have frequently reported rampant errors in the metadata information on Google Books \u2013 including misattributed aut", "hors and erroneous dates of publication. Geoffrey Nunberg, a linguist researching on the changes in word usage over time noticed that a search for books published before 1950 and containing the word \"internet\" turned up an unlikely 527 results. Woody Allen is mentioned in 325 books ostensibly published before he was born. Google responded to Nunberg by blaming the bulk of errors on outside contractors.\nOther metadata errors reported include publication dates before the author's birth (e.g. 182 works by Charles Dickens prior to his birth in 1812); incorrect subject classifications (an edition of Moby Dick found under \"computers\", a biography of Mae West classified under \"religion\"), conflicting classifications (10 editions of Whitman's Leaves of Grass all classified as both \"fiction\" and \"nonfiction\"), incorrectly spelled titles, authors, and publishers (Moby Dick: or the White \"Wall\"), and metadata for one book incorrectly appended to a completely different book (the metadata for an 1818 mathematical work leads to a 1963 romance novel).\n\nA review of the author, title, publisher, and publication year metadata elements for 400 randomly selected Google Books records was undertaken. The results show 36% of sampled books in the digitization project contained metadata errors. This error rate is higher than one would expect to find in a typical library online catalog.\nThe overall error rate of 36.75% found in this study suggests that Google Books' metadata has a high rate of error. While \"major\" and \"minor\" errors are a subjective distinction based on the somewhat indeterminate concept of \"findability\", the errors found in the four metadata elements examined in this study should all be considered major.\nMetadata errors based on incorrect scanned dates makes research using the Google Books Project database difficult. Google has shown only limited interest in cleaning up these errors.\n\n\n=== Language issues ===\nSome European politicians and intellectuals have criticized Googl", "e's effort on linguistic imperialism grounds. They argue that because the vast majority of books proposed to be scanned are in English, it will result in disproportionate representation of natural languages in the digital world. German, Russian, French, and Spanish, for instance, are popular languages in scholarship. The disproportionate online emphasis on English, however, could shape access to historical scholarship, and, ultimately, the growth and direction of future scholarship. Among these critics is Jean-No\u00ebl Jeanneney, the former president of the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France.\n\n\n=== Google Books versus Google Scholar ===\nWhile Google Books has digitized large numbers of journal back issues, its scans do not include the metadata required for identifying specific articles in specific issues. This has led the makers of Google Scholar to start their own program to digitize and host older journal articles (in agreement with their publishers).\n\n\n== Library partners ==\nThe Google Books Library Project is aimed at scanning and making searchable the collections of several major research libraries. Along with bibliographic information, snippets of text from a book are often viewable. If a book is out of copyright and in the public domain, the book is fully available to read or download.\nIn-copyright books scanned through the Library Project are made available on Google Books for snippet view. Regarding the quality of scans, Google acknowledges that they are \"not always of sufficiently high quality\" to be offered for sale on Google Play. Also, because of supposed technical constraints, Google does not replace scans with higher quality versions that may be provided by the publishers.\nThe project is the subject of the Authors Guild v. Google lawsuit, filed in 2005 and ruled in favor of Google in 2013, and again, on appeal, in 2015.\nCopyright owners can claim the rights for a scanned book and make it available for preview or full view (by \"transferring\" it to their Part", "ner Program account), or request Google to prevent the book text from being searched.\nThe number of institutions participating in the Library Project has grown since its inception.\n\n\n=== Initial partners ===\n\nHarvard University, Harvard University Library\nThe Harvard University Library and Google conducted a pilot throughout 2005. The project continued, with the aim of increasing online access to the holdings of the Harvard University Library, which includes more than 15.8 million volumes. While physical access to Harvard's library materials is generally restricted to current Harvard students, faculty, and researchers, or to scholars who can come to Cambridge, the Harvard-Google Project has been designed to enable both members of the Harvard community and users everywhere to discover works in the Harvard collection.\nUniversity of Michigan, University of Michigan Library\nAs of March 2012, 5.5 million volumes were scanned.\nNew York Public Library\nIn this pilot program, NYPL is working with Google to offer a collection of its public domain books, which will be scanned in their entirety and made available for free to the public online. Users will be able to search and browse the full text of these works. When the scanning process is complete, the books may be accessed from both The New York Public Library's website and from the Google search engine.\nUniversity of Oxford, Bodleian Library\nStanford University, Stanford University Libraries (SULAIR)\n\n\n=== Additional partners ===\nOther institutional partners have joined the project since the partnership was first announced:\n\nAustrian National Library\nBavarian State Library\nBiblioth\u00e8que municipale de Lyon\nBig Ten Academic Alliance\nColumbia University, Columbia University Library System\nComplutense University of Madrid\nCornell University, Cornell University Library\nGhent University, Ghent University Library/Boekentoren\nKeio University, Keio Media Centers (Libraries)\nNational Library of Catalonia\nPrinceton University, Princeto", "n University Library\nUniversity of California, California Digital Library\nUniversity of Lausanne, Cantonal and University Library of Lausanne\nUniversity of Mysore, Mysore University Library\nThe partnership was for digitizing 800,000 texts, including manuscripts written in palm leaves dating back to 8th century.\nUniversity of Texas at Austin, University of Texas Libraries\nThe partnership was for digitizing the library's Latin American collection \u2013 about half a million volumes.\nUniversity of Virginia, University of Virginia Library\nUniversity of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, University of Wisconsin Libraries\nAs of March 2012, about 600,000 volumes had been scanned.\n\n\n== History ==\n2002: A group of team members at Google officially launch the \"secret 'books' project.\" Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page came up with the idea that later became Google Books while still graduate students at Stanford in 1996. The history page on the Google Books website describes their initial vision for this project: \"in a future world in which vast collections of books are digitized, people would use a 'web crawler' to index the books' content and analyze the connections between them, determining any given book's relevance and usefulness by tracking the number and quality of citations from other books.\" This team visited the sites of some of the larger digitization efforts at that time including the Library of Congress's American Memory Project, Project Gutenberg, and the Universal Library to find out how they work, as well as the University of Michigan, Page's alma mater, and the base for such digitization projects as JSTOR and Making of America. In a conversation with the at that time University President Mary Sue Coleman, when Page found out that the university's current estimate for scanning all the library's volumes was 1,000 years, Page reportedly told Coleman that he \"believes Google can help make it happen in six.\"\n2003: The team works to develop a high-speed scanning process as well", " as software for resolving issues in odd type sizes, unusual fonts, and \"other unexpected peculiarities.\"\nDecember 2004: Google signaled an extension to its Google Print initiative known as the Google Print Library Project. Google announced partnerships with several high-profile university and public libraries, including the University of Michigan, Harvard (Harvard University Library), Stanford (Green Library), Oxford (Bodleian Library), and the New York Public Library. According to press releases and university librarians, Google planned to digitize and make available through its Google Books service approximately 15 million volumes within a decade. The announcement soon triggered controversy, as publisher and author associations challenged Google's plans to digitize, not just books in the public domain, but also titles still under copyright.\nSeptember\u2013October 2005: Two lawsuits against Google charge that the company has not respected copyrights and has failed to properly compensate authors and publishers. One is a class action suit on behalf of authors (Authors Guild v. Google, September 20, 2005) and the other is a civil lawsuit brought by five large publishers and the Association of American Publishers. (McGraw Hill v. Google, October 19, 2005)\nNovember 2005: Google changed the name of this service from Google Print to Google Book Search. Its program enabling publishers and authors to include their books in the service was renamed Google Books Partner Program, and the partnership with libraries became Google Books Library Project.\n2006: Google added a \"download a pdf\" button to all its out-of-copyright, public domain books. It also added a new browsing interface along with new \"About this Book\" pages.\nAugust 2006: The University of California System announced that it would join the Books digitization project. This includes a portion of the 34 million volumes within the approximately 100 libraries managed by the System.\nSeptember 2006: The Complutense University ", "of Madrid became the first Spanish-language library to join the Google Books Library Project.\nOctober 2006: The University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison announced that it would join the Book Search digitization project along with the Wisconsin Historical Society Library. Combined, the libraries have 7.2 million holdings.\nNovember 2006: The University of Virginia joined the project. Its libraries contain more than five million volumes and more than 17 million manuscripts, rare books and archives.\nJanuary 2007: The University of Texas at Austin announced that it would join the Book Search digitization project. At least one million volumes would be digitized from the university's 13 library locations.\nMarch 2007: The Bavarian State Library announced a partnership with Google to scan more than a million public domain and out-of-print works in German as well as English, French, Italian, Latin, and Spanish.\nMay 2007: A book digitizing project partnership was announced jointly by Google and the Cantonal and University Library of Lausanne.\nMay 2007: The Boekentoren Library of Ghent University announced that it would participate with Google in digitizing and making digitized versions of 19th century books in the French and Dutch languages available online.\nMay 2007: Mysore University announces Google will digitize over 800,000 books and manuscripts\u2013including around 100,000 manuscripts written in Sanskrit or Kannada on both paper and palm leaves.\nJune 2007: The Committee on Institutional Cooperation (rebranded as the Big Ten Academic Alliance in 2016) announced that its twelve member libraries would participate in scanning 10 million books over the course of the next six years.\nJuly 2007: Keio University became Google's first library partner in Japan with the announcement that they would digitize at least 120,000 public domain books.\nAugust 2007: Google announced that it would digitize up to 500,000 both copyrighted and public domain items from Cornell University Library. Google would", " also provide a digital copy of all works scanned to be incorporated into the university's own library system.\nSeptember 2007: Google added a feature that allows users to share snippets of books that are in the public domain. The snippets may appear exactly as they do in the scan of the book, or as plain text.\nSeptember 2007: Google debuted a new feature called \"My Library\" which allows users to create personal customized libraries, selections of books that they can label, review, rate, or full-text search.\nDecember 2007: Columbia University was added as a partner in digitizing public domain works.\nMay 2008: Microsoft tapered off and planned to end its scanning project, which had reached 750,000 books and 80 million journal articles.\nOctober 2008: A settlement was reached between the publishing industry and Google after two years of negotiation. Google agreed to compensate authors and publishers in exchange for the right to make millions of books available to the public.\nOctober 2008: The HathiTrust \"Shared Digital Repository\" (later known as the HathiTrust Digital Library) is launched jointly by the Committee on Institutional Cooperation and the 11 university libraries in the University of California system, all of which were Google partner libraries, in order to archive and provide academic access to books from their collections scanned by Google and others.\nNovember 2008: Google reached the 7 million book mark for items scanned by Google and by their publishing partners. 1 million were in full preview mode and 1 million were fully viewable and downloadable public domain works. About five million were out of print.\nDecember 2008: Google announced the inclusion of magazines in Google Books. Titles include New York Magazine, Ebony, and Popular Mechanics\nFebruary 2009: Google launched a mobile version of Google Book Search, allowing iPhone and Android phone users to read over 1.5 million public domain works in the US (and over 500,000 outside the US) using a mobile b", "rowser.

According to the New York Times, Google has scanned more than 25 million books.\nApril 2016: The US Supreme Court declined to hear the Authors Guild's appeal, which means the lower court's decision stood, and Google would be allowed to scan library books and display snippets in search results without violating the law.\n\n\n=== Status ===\nGoogle has been quite secretive regarding its plans on the future of the Google Books project. Scanning operations had been slowing down since at least 2012, as confirmed by the librarians at several of Google's partner institutions. At University of Wisconsin, the speed had reduced to less than half of what it was in 2006. However, the librarians have said that the dwindling pace could be a natural result of maturation of the project \u2013 initially stacks of books were entirely taken up for scanning whereas now only the titles that had not already been scanned needed to be considered. The company's own Google Books timeline page did not mention anything after 2007 even in 2017, and the Google Books blog was merged into the Google Search blog in 2012.\nDespite winning the decade-long litigation in 2017, The Atlantic has said that Google has \"all but shut down its scanning operation.\" In April 2017, Wired reported that there were only a few Google employees working on the project, and new books were still being scanned, but at a significantly lower rate. It commented that the decade-long legal battle had caused Google to lose its ambition.\n\n\n== Legal issues ==\n\nThrough the project, library books were being digitized somewhat indiscriminately regardless of copyright status, which led to a number of lawsuits against Google. By the end of 2008, Google had reportedly digitized over seven million books,", " of which only about one million were works in the public domain. Of the rest, one million were in copyright and in print, and five million were in copyright but out of print. In 2005, a group of authors and publishers brought a major class-action lawsuit against Google for infringement on the copyrighted works. Google argued that it was preserving \"orphaned works\" \u2013 books still under copyright, but whose copyright holders could not be located.\nThe Authors Guild and Association of American Publishers separately sued Google in 2005 for its book project, citing \"massive copyright infringement.\" Google countered that its project represented a fair use and is the digital age equivalent of a card catalog with every word in the publication indexed. The lawsuits were consolidated, and eventually a settlement was proposed. The settlement received significant criticism on a wide variety of grounds, including antitrust, privacy, and inadequacy of the proposed classes of authors and publishers. The settlement was eventually rejected, and the publishers settled with Google soon after. The Authors Guild continued its case, and in 2011 their proposed class was certified. Google appealed that decision, with a number of amici asserting the inadequacy of the class, and the Second Circuit rejected the class certification in July 2013, remanding the case to the District Court for consideration of Google's fair use defense.\nIn 2015 Authors Guild filed another appeal against Google to be considered by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York. Google won the case unanimously based on the argument that they were not showing people the full texts but instead snippets, and they are not allowing people to illegally read the book. In a report, courts stated that they did not infringe on copyright laws, as they were protected under the fair use clause.\nAuthors Guild tried again in 2016 to appeal the decision and this time took their case to be considered by the Supreme Court. The case", " was rejected, leaving the Second Circuit's decision on the case intact, meaning that Google did not violate copyright laws. This case also set a precedent for other similar cases in regards to fair use laws, as it further clarified the law and expanded it. Such clarification affects other scanning projects similar to Google.\nOther lawsuits followed the Authors Guild's lead. In 2006 a German lawsuit, previously filed, was withdrawn. In June 2006, Herv\u00e9 de la Martini\u00e8re, a French publisher known as La Martini\u00e8re and \u00c9ditions du Seuil, announced its intention to sue Google France. In 2009, the Paris Civil Court awarded 300,000 EUR (approximately 430,000 USD) in damages and interest and ordered Google to pay 10,000 EUR a day until it removes the publisher's books from its database. The court wrote, \"Google violated author copyright laws by fully reproducing and making accessible\" books that Seuil owns without its permission and that Google \"committed acts of breach of copyright, which are of harm to the publishers\". Google said it will appeal. Syndicat National de l'Edition, which joined the lawsuit, said Google has scanned about 100,000 French works under copyright.\nIn December 2009, Chinese author Mian Mian filed a civil lawsuit for $8,900 against Google for scanning her novel, Acid Lovers. This is the first such lawsuit to be filed against Google in China. Also, in November that year, the China Written Works Copyright Society (CWWCS) accused Google of scanning 18,000 books by 570 Chinese writers without authorization. Google agreed on Nov 20 to provide a list of Chinese books it had scanned, but the company refused to admit having \"infringed\" copyright laws.\nIn March 2007, Thomas Rubin, associate general counsel for copyright, trademark, and trade secrets at Microsoft, accused Google of violating copyright law with their book search service. Rubin specifically criticized Google's policy of freely copying any work until notified by the copyright holder to stop.\nGoogl", "e licensing of public domain works is also an area of concern due to using of digital watermarking techniques with the books. Some published works that are in the public domain, such as all works created by the U.S. Federal government, are still treated like other works under copyright, and therefore locked after 1922.\n\n\n== Similar projects ==\nProject Gutenberg is a volunteer effort to digitize and archive cultural works, to \"encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks\". It was founded in 1971 by Michael S. Hart and is the oldest digital library. As of October 3, 2015, Project Gutenberg reached 50,000 items in its collection.\nInternet Archive is a non-profit which digitizes over 1000 books a day, as well as mirrors books from Google Books and other sources. As of May 2011, it hosted over 2.8 million public domain books, greater than the approximate 1 million public domain books at Google Books. Open Library, a sister project of Internet Archive, lends 80,000 scanned and purchased commercial ebooks to the visitors of 150 libraries.\nHathiTrust maintains HathiTrust Digital Library since October 13, 2008, which preserves and provides access to material scanned by Google, some of the Internet Archive books, and some scanned locally by partner institutions.

Archived from the original on February 2, 2007.", "The deuterocanonical books, meaning \"Of, pertaining to, or constituting a second canon,\"  collectively known as the Deuterocanon (DC), are certain books and passages considered to be canonical books of the Old Testament by the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Churches and the Assyrian Church of the East, but which modern Jews and many Protestants regard as Apocrypha.\nSeven books are accepted as deuterocanonical by all the ancient churches: Tobias, Judith, Baruch, Ecclesiasticus, Wisdom, First and Second Maccabees and also the Greek additions to Esther and Daniel. In addition to these, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Churches and the Assyrian Church of the East add other books to their canons. \nThey date from 300 BC to 100 AD, before the separation of the Christian church from Judaism, and they are regularly found in old manuscripts and cited frequently by the Church Fathers, such as Clement of Rome, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Irenaeus, Tertullian, among others.\nAccording to the Gelasian Decree written by an anonymous author, the Council of Rome (382 AD) defined a list of books of scripture as canonical. It included most of the deuterocanonical books.  Patristic and synodal lists from the 200s, 300s and 400s usually include selections of the deutorocanonical books.\n\n\n== Hebrew Bible canon ==\n\nAlthough there is no scholarly consensus as to when the Hebrew Bible canon was fixed, some scholars hold that the Hebrew canon was established well before the 1st century AD \u2013 even as early as the 4th century BC, or by the Hasmonean dynasty (140\u201340 BC). \nThe canon of modern Rabbinic Judaism excludes the deuterocanonical books. Albert J. Sundberg writes that Judaism did not exclude from their scriptures the deuterocanonicals and the additional Greek texts listed here.\n\n\n== Ancient Christian canons ==\nThe Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek, which the early Christian church used as its Old Testament, inclu", "ded all of the deuterocanonical books. The term distinguished these books from both the protocanonical books (the books of the Hebrew canon) and the biblical apocrypha (books of Jewish origin that were sometimes read in Christian churches as scripture but which were not regarded as canonical).\nSome commentators see texts from these particular books being paraphrased, referred, or alluded to many times in the New Testament, depending in large measure on what is counted as a reference; other scholars point to a correspondence of thought.\n\n\n== Protestant canon ==\nFor churches which espouse sola scriptura independent of ecclesiastical authorities or sacred Tradition, it is necessary and critical to have a clear and complete list of the canonical books.  \nThe early Christian church largely relied upon the Septuagint in the canonization of the Christian Bible. In the 16th century, Martin Luther argued that many of the received texts of the New Testament lacked the authority of the Gospels, and therefore proposed removing a number of books from the New Testament, including Hebrews, James, Jude, and the Book of Revelation. While this proposal was not widely accepted among Protestants, the deuterocanonical books\u2014which had previously been deprecated by Jewish scholars\u2014were moved by Luther into an intertestamental section of the Bible called the apocrypha. \nLutherans and Anglicans do not consider these books to be canonical but do consider them worthy of reverence. As such, readings from the Protestant apocrypha are found in the lectionaries of these churches. Anabaptists use the Luther Bible, which contains the apocrypha as intertestamental books; Amish wedding ceremonies include \"the retelling of the marriage of Tobias and Sarah in the Apocrypha\".\n\n\n== List of deuterocanonicals ==\n\nCanonical for the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Church and the Church of the East:\n\nTobit\nJudith\nBaruch including the Letter of Jeremiah (Baruch chapter 6)\nSi", "rach (or Ecclesiasticus)\n1 Maccabees\n2 Maccabees\nWisdom\nGreek additions to Esther \nGreek additions to Daniel \nCanonical only for the Eastern Orthodox Church:\n\nPrayer of Manasseh\n1 Esdras\n2 Esdras\n3 Maccabees\n4 Maccabees as an appendix\nAdditions to Psalms:\nPsalm 151\n\n\n=== Dates of composition ===\n\n\n== Historical background ==\n\nDeuterocanonical is a term coined in 1566 by the theologian Sixtus of Siena, who had converted to Catholicism from Judaism, to describe scriptural texts considered canonical by the Catholic Church, but which recognition was considered \"secondary\". For Sixtus, this term included portions of both Old and New Testaments. Sixtus considers the final chapter of the Gospel of Mark to be deuterocanonical. He also applies the term to the Book of Esther from the canon of the Hebrew Bible.\nThe term was then taken up by other writers to apply specifically to those books of the Old Testament which had been recognised as canonical by the Councils of Rome (382 AD), Hippo (393 AD), Carthage (397 AD and 419 AD), Florence (1442 AD) and Trent (1546 AD), but which were not in the Hebrew canon.\nForms of the term \u201cdeuterocanonical\u201d were adopted after the 16th century by the Eastern Orthodox Church to denote canonical books of the Septuagint not in the Hebrew Bible, a wider selection than that adopted by the Council of Trent, and also by the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church to apply to works believed to be of Jewish origin translated in the Old Testament of the Ethiopic Bible, a wider selection still.\nThe acceptance of some of these books among early Christians was widespread, though not universal, and surviving Bibles from the early Church always include, with varying degrees of recognition, books now called deuterocanonical. Some say that their canonicity seems not to have been doubted in the Church until it was challenged by Jews after 100 AD, sometimes postulating a hypothetical Council of Jamnia. Regional councils in the West published official canons that inc", "luded these books as early as the 4th and 5th centuries.\nThe Catholic Encyclopedia states:\n\nThe official attitude of the Latin Church, always favourable to them, kept the majestic tenor of its way. Two documents of capital importance in the history of the canon constitute the first formal utterance of papal authority on the subject. The first is the so-called \"Decretal of Gelasius\", the essential part of which is now generally attributed to a synod convoked by Pope Damasus in the year 382. The other is the Canon of Innocent I, sent in 405 to a Gallican bishop in answer to an inquiry. Both contain all the deuterocanonicals, without any distinction, and are identical with the catalogue of Trent. The African Church, always a staunch supporter of the contested books, found itself in entire accord with Rome on this question. Its ancient version, the Vetus Latina, had admitted all the Old Testament Scriptures. St. Augustine seems to theoretically recognize degrees of inspiration; in practice he employs protos and deuteros without any discrimination whatsoever. Moreover in his \"De Doctrin\u00e2 Christian\u00e2\" he enumerates the components of the complete Old Testament. The Synod of Hippo (393) and the three of Carthage (393, 397, and 419), in which, doubtless, Augustine was the leading spirit, found it necessary to deal explicitly with the question of the Canon, and drew up identical lists from which no sacred books are excluded. These councils base their canon on tradition and liturgical usage.\n\n\n=== Dead Sea scrolls ===\nThe Book of Sirach, whose Hebrew text was already known from the Cairo Geniza, has been found in two of the Dead Sea Scrolls (2QSir or 2Q18, 11QPs_a or 11Q5) in Hebrew. Another Hebrew scroll of Sirach has been found in Masada (MasSir).:\u200a597\u200a Five fragments from the Book of Tobit have been found in Qumran written in Aramaic and in one written in Hebrew (papyri 4Q, nos. 196\u2013200).:\u200a636\u200a The Letter of Jeremiah (or Baruch chapter 6) has been found in cave 7 (papyrus 7Q", "2) in Greek.:\u200a628\u200a \nRecent scholars have suggested that the Qumran library of approximately 1,100 manuscripts found in the eleven caves at Qumran was not entirely produced at Qumran, but may have included part of the library of the Jerusalem Temple, that may have been hidden in the caves for safekeeping at the time the Temple was destroyed by Romans in 70 AD.\n\n\n=== Influence of the Septuagint ===\nDeuterocanonical and Apocryphal books included in the Septuagint are:\n\nThe large majority of Old Testament references in the New Testament are taken from the Koine Greek Septuagint (LXX), editions of which include the deuterocanonical books, as well as apocrypha \u2013 both of which are called collectively anagignoskomena (\"readable, worthy of reading\"). No two Septuagint codices contain the same apocrypha.\nGreek Psalm manuscripts from the fifth century contain three New Testament \"psalms\": the Magnificat, the Benedictus, the Nunc dimittis from Luke's birth narrative, and the conclusion of the hymn that begins with the \"Gloria in Excelsis\". Beckwith states that manuscripts of anything like the capacity of Codex Alexandrinus were not used in the first centuries of the Christian era, and believes that the comprehensive codices of the Septuagint, which start appearing in the 4th century AD, are all of Christian origin.\nIn the New Testament, Hebrews 11:35 is understood by some as referring to an event that was recorded in one of the deuterocanonical books, 2 Maccabees. For instance, the author of Hebrews references oral tradition which spoke of an Old Testament prophet who was sawn in half in Hebrews 11:37, two verses after the 2nd Maccabees reference. Other New Testament authors such as Paul also reference or quote period literature.\n\n\n=== Influence of early authors ===\nThe Jewish historian Josephus (c.\u200994 AD) wrote that the Hebrew Bible contained 22 canonical books. The same number of 22 books was reported also by the Christian bishop Athanasius, but they might differ on the exact", " content (see below for Athanasius), as Josephus did not provide a detailed list.\nOrigen of Alexandria (c.\u2009240 AD), cited by Eusebius, described the Hebrew Bible as containing 22 canonical books. Among these books he listed the Epistle of Jeremiah and the Maccabees.\n\nThe twenty-two books of the Hebrews are the following: That which is called by us Genesis; Exodus; Leviticus; Numbers; Jesus, the son of Nave (Joshua book); Judges and Ruth in one book; the First and Second of Kings (1 Samuel and 2 Samuel) in one; the Third and Fourth of Kings (1 Kings and 2 Kings) in one; of the Chronicles, the First and Second in one; Esdras, First and Second (Ezra\u2013Nehemiah) in one; the book of Psalms; the Proverbs of Solomon; Ecclesiastes; the Song of Songs; Isaiah; Jeremiah, with Lamentations and the epistle (of Jeremiah) in one; Daniel; Ezekiel; Job; Esther. And besides these there are the Maccabees.\nEusebius wrote in his Church History (c.\u2009324 AD) that Bishop Melito of Sardis in the 2nd century AD considered the deuterocanonical Wisdom of Solomon as part of the Old Testament and that it was considered canonical by Jews and Christians. On the other hand, the contrary claim has been made: \"In the catalogue of Melito, presented by Eusebius, after Proverbs, the word Wisdom occurs, which nearly all commentators have been of opinion is only another name for the same book, and not the name of the book now called 'The Wisdom of Solomon'.\"\nCyril of Jerusalem (c.\u2009350 AD) in his Catechetical Lectures cites as canonical books \"Jeremiah one, including Baruch and Lamentations and the Epistle (of Jeremiah)\".\nIn Athanasius's canonical books list (367 AD) the Book of Baruch and the Letter of Jeremiah are included while Esther is omitted. At the same time, he mentioned that the Wisdom of Solomon, the Wisdom of Sirach, Judith and Tobit, the book of Esther and also the Didache and The Shepherd of Hermas, while not being part of the Canon, \"were appointed by the Fathers to be read\". He excluded what h", "e called \"apocryphal writings\" entirely.\nEpiphanius of Salamis (c.\u2009385 AD) mentions that \"there are 27 books given the Jews by God, but they are counted as 22, however, like the letters of their Hebrew alphabet, because ten books are doubled and reckoned as five\". He wrote in his Panarion that Jews had in their books the deuterocanonical Epistle of Jeremiah and Baruch, both combined with Jeremiah and Lamentations in only one book. While Wisdom of Sirach and the Wisdom of Solomon were books of disputed canonicity.\nAugustine of Hippo (c.\u2009397 AD), in his book On Christian Doctrine (Book II Chapter 8), cites a list of the canon of the Old Testament and the New Testament, including the deuterocanonical books as canonical:\n\nNow the whole canon of Scripture on which we say this judgment is to be exercised, is contained in the following books: \u2013 Five books of Moses, that is, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy; one book of Joshua the son of Nun; one of Judges; one short book called Ruth; next, four books of Kings [the two Books of Samuel and the two books of Kings], and two of Chronicles, Job, and Tobias, and Esther, and Judith, and the two books of Maccabees, and the two of Ezra [Ezra, Nehemiah]; one book of the Psalms of David; and three books of Solomon, that is to say Proverbs, Song of Songs, and Ecclesiastes. For two books, one called Wisdom and the other Ecclesiasticus. Twelve separate books of the prophets which are connected with one another, and having never been disjoined, are reckoned as one book; the names of these prophets are as follows: Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi; then there are the four greater prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, Ezekiel.\nAccording to the monk Rufinus of Aquileia (c.\u2009400 AD) the deuterocanonical books were not called canonical but ecclesiastical books. In this category Rufinus includes the Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach, Judith, Tobit and two books of Maccabees. Ba", "ruch is not specified by name in Rufinus's list, but it is in Cyril's, as though a part of Jeremiah, \"Jeremiah, with Baruch, and the Lamentations and the Epistle.\" (Catech. 4, \u00a736.) \nPope Innocent I (405 AD) sent a letter to the bishop of Toulouse citing deuterocanonical books as a part of the Old Testament canon.\n\nWhich books really are received in the canon, this brief addition shows. These therefore are the things of which you desired to be informed. Five books of Moses, that is, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, and Joshua the son of Nun, and Judges, and the four books of Kings [the two Books of Samuel and the two books of Kings] together with Ruth, sixteen books of the Prophets, five books of Solomon [Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Wisdom of Solomon, and Ecclesiasticus], and the Psalms. Also of the historical books, one book of Job, one of Tobit, one of Esther, one of Judith, two of Maccabees, two of Ezra [Ezra, Nehemiah], two of Chronicles.\nIn the 7th century Latin document the Muratorian fragment, which some scholars actually believe to be a copy of an earlier 170 AD Greek original, the book of the Wisdom of Solomon is counted by the church.\n\nMoreover, the epistle of Jude and two of the above-mentioned (or, bearing the name of) John are counted (or, used) in the catholic [Church]; and [the book of] Wisdom, written by the friends of Solomon in his honour.\n\n\n=== Synods ===\nIn later copyings of the canons of the Council of Laodicea (from 364 AD) a canon list became appended to Canon 59, likely before the mid fifth century, which affirmed that Jeremiah, and Baruch, the Lamentations, and the Epistle (of Jeremiah) were canonical, while excluding the other deuterocanonical books.\nAccording to Decretum Gelasianum, which is a work written by an anonymous scholar between 519 and 553, the Council of Rome (382 AD) cites a list of books of scripture presented as having been made canonical. This list mentions all the deuterocanonical books as a ", "part of the Old Testament canon: \n\nGenesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Kings IV books [1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2 Kings], Chronicles II books, 150 Psalms, three books of Solomon [Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs], Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Isaiah, Jeremiah with Cinoth i.e. his lamentations, Ezechiel, Daniel, Hosea, Amos, Micah, Joel, Obadiah, Jonah, Nahum, Habbakuk Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi, Job, Tobit, Esdras II books [Ezra, Nehemiah], Ester, Judith, Maccabees II books.\n(According to the Council of Laodicea, Athanasius, Cyril of Jerusalem, and Epiphanius of Salamis, the Book of Jeremiah forms a single book together with Baruch, Lamentations and the Letter of Jeremiah, also called the Epistle of Jeremiah.)\nThe Synod of Hippo (in 393 AD), followed by the Council of Carthage (397) and the Council of Carthage (419), may be the first councils that explicitly accepted the first canon which includes a selection of books that did not appear in the Hebrew Bible; the councils were under significant influence of Augustine of Hippo, who regarded the canon as already closed.\nCanon XXIV from the Synod of Hippo (in 393 AD) records the scriptures which are considered canonical; the Old Testament books as follows:\n\nGenesis; Exodus; Leviticus; Numbers; Deuteronomy; Joshua the Son of Nun; The Judges; Ruth; The Kings, iv. books [1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2 Kings]; The Chronicles, ii. books; Job; The Psalter; The Five books of Solomon [Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Wisdom of Solomon, and Ecclesiasticus]; The Twelve Books of the Prophets [Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi]; Isaiah; Jeremiah; Ezechiel; Daniel; Tobit; Judith; Esther; Ezra, ii. books [Ezra, Nehemiah]; Maccabees, ii. books.\nOn 28 August 397, the Council of Carthage confirmed the canon issued at Hippo; the recurrence of the Old Testament part is stated:\n\nGenesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuter", "onomy, Joshua the son of Nun, Judges, Ruth, four books of Kings [1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2 Kings], two books of Paraleipomena [1 Chronicles, 2 Chronicles], Job, the Psalter, five books of Solomon [ Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Wisdom of Solomon, and Ecclesiasticus ], the books of the twelve prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezechiel, Daniel, Tobit, Judith, Esther, two books of Esdras [Ezra, Nehemiah], two Books of the Maccabees.\nIn 419 AD, the Council of Carthage in its canon 24 lists the deuterocanonical books as canonical scripture: \n\nThe Canonical Scriptures are as follows: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua the son of Nun, Judges, Ruth, four books of Kings [1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2 Kings], two books of Chronicles, Job, the Psalter, five books of Solomon [Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Wisdom of Solomon, and Ecclesiasticus], the books of the twelve prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezechiel, Daniel, Tobit, Judith, Esther, two books of Esdras [Ezra, Nehemiah], two Books of the Maccabees.\n(According to the Council of Laodicea, Athanasius, Cyril of Jerusalem, and Epiphanius of Salamis, the Book of Jeremiah forms a single book together with Baruch, Lamentations and the Letter of Jeremiah, also called the Epistle of Jeremiah.)\nThe Apostolic Canons approved by the Eastern Council in Trullo in 692 AD (not recognized by the Catholic Church) states as venerable and sacred the first three books of Maccabees and Wisdom of Sirach.\nThe Council of Florence (1442) promulgated a list of the books of the Bible, including the books of Judith, Esther, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch and two books of the Maccabees as Canonical books:\n\nFive books of Moses, namely Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy;

the twelve minor prophets, namely Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi; two books of the Maccabees.\nThe Council of Trent (1546) adopted an understanding of the canons of these previous councils as corresponding to its own list of deuterocanonical books:\n\nOf the Old Testament, the five books of Moses, namely, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy; Josue, Judges, Ruth, the four books of Kings [1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2 Kings], two of Paralipomenon [1 Chronicles, 2 Chronicles], the first and second of Esdras [Ezra, Nehemiah], Tobias, Judith, Esther, Job, the Davidic Psalter of 150 Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, the Canticle of Canticles [Song of Songs], Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Isaias, Jeremias, with Baruch, Ezechiel, Daniel, the twelve minor Prophets, namely, Osee, Joel, Amos, Abdias, Jonas, Micheas, Nahum, Habacuc, Sophonias, Aggeus, Zacharias, Malachias; two books of Machabees, the first and second.\n\n\n=== Influence of Jerome ===\n\nJerome in one of his Vulgate prologues describes a canon which excludes the deuterocanonical books. In these prologues, Jerome mentions all of the deuterocanonical and apocryphal works by name as being apocryphal or \"not in the canon\" except for Prayer of Manasses and Baruch. He mentions Baruch by name in his Prologue to Jeremiah and notes that it is neither read nor held among the Hebrews, but does not explicitly call it apocryphal or \"not in the canon\". The inferior status to which the deuterocanonical books were relegated by authorities like Jerome is seen by some as being due to a rigid conception of canonicity, one demanding that a book, to be entitled to this supreme dignity, must be received by all, must have the sanction of Jewish antiquity, and must moreover be adapted not only to edification, but also to the \"confirmation of the doctrine of the Church\".\nJ. N. D. Kelly states that \"Jero", "me, conscious of the difficulty of arguing with Jews on the basis of books they spurned and anyhow regarding the Hebrew original as authoritative, was adamant that anything not found in it was 'to be classed among the apocrypha', not in the canon; later he grudgingly conceded that the Church read some of these books for edification, but not to support doctrine.\"\nJerome's Vulgate included the deuterocanonical books as well as apocrypha. Jerome referenced and quoted from some as scripture despite describing them as \"not in the canon\". Michael Barber asserts that, although Jerome was once suspicious of the apocrypha, he later viewed them as scripture. Barber argues that this is clear from Jerome's epistles; he cites Jerome's letter to Eustochium, in which Jerome quotes Sirach 13:2. Elsewhere Jerome apparently also refers to Baruch, the Story of Susannah and Wisdom as scripture. Henry Barker states that Jerome quotes the Apocrypha with marked respect, and even as \"Scripture\", giving them an ecclesiastical if not a canonical position and use. Luther also wrote introductions to the books of the Apocrypha, and occasionally quoted from some to support an argument.\nIn his prologue to Judith, without using the word canon, Jerome mentioned that Judith was held to be scriptural by the First Council of Nicaea.\n\nAmong the Hebrews the Book of Judith is found among the Hagiographa. ...But because this book is found by the Nicene Council to have been counted among the number of the Sacred Scriptures, I have acquiesced to your request. \nIn his reply to Rufinus, Jerome affirmed that he was consistent with the choice of the church regarding which version of the deuterocanonical portions of Daniel to use, which the Jews of his day did not include:\n\nWhat sin have I committed in following the judgment of the churches? But when I repeat what the Jews say against the Story of Susanna and the Hymn of the Three Children, and the fables of Bel and the Dragon, which are not contained in the Heb", "rew Bible, the man who makes this a charge against me proves himself to be a fool and a slanderer; for I explained not what I thought but what they commonly say against us. (Against Rufinus, II:33 [402 AD])\nThus Jerome acknowledged the principle by which the canon would be settled\u2014the judgment of the Church (at least the local churches in this case) rather than his own judgment or the judgment of Jews; though concerning translation of Daniel to Greek, he wondered why one should use the version of a translator whom he regarded as a heretic and judaizer (Theodotion).\nThe Vulgate is also important as the touchstone of the canon concerning which parts of books are canonical. When the Council of Trent confirmed the books included in the first canon, it qualified the books as being \"entire with all their parts, as they have been used to be read in the Catholic Church, and as they are contained in the old Latin vulgate edition\". This decree was clarified somewhat by Pope Pius XI on 2 June 1927, who allowed that the Comma Johanneum was open to dispute.\nThe Council of Trent also ratified the Vulgate Bible as the official Latin version of the Bible for the Roman Catholic Church.\nDeuterocanonical and Apocryphal books included in the Latin Vulgate are:\n\n\n=== Masoretic Text ===\nThe existence of the Septuagint, Samaritan Pentateuch, and the Peshitta versions of the Hebrew scriptures demonstrate that different versions of Judaism used different texts, and it is debated which is closest to the Urtext (a theoretical \"original\" text from which all of these emerged). The Dead Sea Scrolls contain some of the deuterocanonical books, while the Masoretic Text excludes them. Since the Enlightenment, it was wrongly believed that the Masoretic Text was the \"original\" Hebrew Bible when this was in fact a medieval version created by the Masoretes. The oldest nearly-complete manuscripts of the Old Testament include the Codex Vaticanus (4th century) and the Codex Alexandrinus (5th century), whil", "e the oldest complete manuscript of the Masoretic text is the Codex Leningradensis from 1008.\nThe Septuagint was the version of the Hebrew Bible from which the early Christians emerged. The Christian Bible contained these deuterocanonical books until Martin Luther, assuming the Masoretic text to be the original, removed them to match this new Jewish canon. Rabbinic Judaism is a newer form of Judaism that created the Masoretic text in part to deter a Christian reading of the Old Testament.\n\n\n== In the Catholic Church ==\n\nThe Catholic Church considers that in the Council of Rome in 382 AD, under the Papacy of Damasus I, was defined the complete canon of the Bible, accepting 46 books for the Old Testament, including what the Reformed Churches consider as deuterocanonical books, and 27 books for the New Testament. Based in this first canon, Saint Jerome compiled and translated the 73 books of the Bible into Latin, later known as the Vulgate Bible version, which has been considered during many centuries as one of the official Bible translations of the Catholic Church.\nThe Synod of Hippo (in 393 AD), followed by the Council of Carthage (397) and the Council of Carthage (419), also explicitly accepted the first canon from the Council of Rome. These councils were under significant influence of Augustine of Hippo, who also regarded the Biblical canon as already closed. The Roman Catholic Council of Florence (1442) confirmed the first canon too, while the Council of Trent (1546) elevated the first canon to dogma.\nProtestant theologian Philip Schaff states that \"the Council of Hippo in 393, and the third (according to another reckoning the sixth) Council of Carthage in 397, under the influence of Augustine, who attended both, fixed the catholic canon of the Holy Scriptures, including the Apocrypha of the Old Testament, ...This decision of the transmarine church, however, was subject to ratification; and the concurrence of the Roman See it received when Innocent I and Gelasius ", "I (AD 414) repeated the same index of biblical books.\"\nSchaff says that this canon remained undisturbed till the 16th century, and was sanctioned by the Council of Trent at its fourth session, although as the Catholic Encyclopedia reports, \"in the Latin Church, all through the Middle Ages we find evidence of hesitation about the character of the deuterocanonicals. ... Few are found to unequivocally acknowledge their canonicity,\" but that the countless manuscript copies of the Vulgate produced by these ages, with a slight, probably accidental, exception, uniformly embrace the complete Roman Catholic Old Testament. \nSubsequent research qualifies this latter statement, in that a distinct tradition of large format pandect bibles has been identified as having been promoted by the 11th and 12th century reforming Papacy for presentation to monasteries in Italy; and now commonly termed 'Atlantic Bibles' on account of their very great size. While not all these bibles present a consistent reformed Vulgate text, they generally exclude the deuterocanonical books.\n\n\n=== Baruch ===\nAccording to the canon lists of the Council of Laodicea, Athanasius (367 AD), Cyril of Jerusalem (c.\u2009350 AD), and Epiphanius of Salamis (c.\u2009385 AD), the Book of Jeremiah forms a single book together with Baruch, Lamentations and the Letter of Jeremiah (also called Epistle of Jeremiah).\nIn the Old Latin version of the Bible, Baruch and the Letter of Jeremiah appear to have been incorporated into the Book of Jeremiah, and Latin Fathers of the 4th century and earlier always cite their texts as being from that book. However, when Jerome translated Jeremiah afresh from the Hebrew text, which is considerably longer than the Greek Septuagint text and with chapters in a different order, he steadfastly refused to incorporate either Baruch or the Letter of Jeremiah from the Greek.\nIn the 9th century these two works were reintroduced into the Vulgate Bibles produced under the influence of Theodulf of Orleans, ori", "ginally as additional chapters to the Vulgate book of Jeremiah. Subsequently, and especially in the Paris Bibles of the 13th century, they are found together as a single, combined book after Lamentations.\n\n\n=== Esdras ===\nFor the Roman Catholic Church and Protestant Churches, Greek Esdras is now considered apocryphal. The Orthodox Church considers it as canonical. The earlier canonical status of this book in the Western church can be less easy to track, as references to Esdras in canon lists and citations may refer either to this book, or to Greek Ezra\u2013Nehemiah, or both together. In the surviving Greek pandect Bibles of the 4th and 5th centuries, Greek Esdras always stands as 'Esdras A' while the Greek translation of the whole of canonical Ezra\u2013Nehemiah stands as 'Esdras B'. The same is found in the surviving witness of the Old Latin Bible.\nWhen Latin fathers of the early church cite quotations from the biblical 'Book of Ezra' it is overwhelmingly 'First Ezra/Esdras A' to which they refer, as in Augustine 'City of God' 18:36. Citations of the 'Nehemiah' sections of Old Latin Second Ezra/'Esdras B' are much rarer. No Old Latin citations from the 'Ezra' sections of Second Ezra/'Esdras B' are known before Bede in the 8th century. Consequently Gallagher and Meade conclude that \"when the ancient canon lists, whether Greek or Latin, mention two books of Esdras, they must have in mind the books known in the LXX and Old Latin as Esdras A and Esdras B; i.e. our 1 Esdras and Ezra-Nehemiah.\"\nIn his prologue to Ezra Jerome refers to four books of Ezra in the Latin tradition. Jerome's first and second Latin books of Ezra are those of the Old Latin Bible - corresponding to Greek Esdras and Ezra-Nehemiah in the Septuagint. These two books he considers each to be a corrupt version of the single Hebrew book of Ezra, so he claims that his Vulgate version of Ezra from the Hebrew replaces both of them. Jerome condemns the third and fourth Latin books of Ezra as apocrypha. His third boo", "k must correspond to the Jewish Apocolypse of Ezra while the fourth book is likely to comprise other material from Latin Ezra.\nFrom the 9th century, occasional Latin Vulgate manuscripts are found in which Jerome's single Ezra text is split to form the separate books of Ezra and Nehemiah. In the Paris Bibles of the 13th century this split has become universal, with Esdras A being reintroduced as '3 Esdras' and Latin Esdras being added as '4 Esdras'. At the Council of Trent neither '3 Esdras' nor '4 Esdras' were accepted as canonical books, but were eventually printed in the section of 'Apocrypha' in the Sixto-Clementine Vulgate, along with the Prayer of Manasses.\nThe Council of Trent in 1546 stated the list of books included in the canon as it had been set out in the Council of Florence. In respect to the deuterocanonical books this list conformed with the canon lists of Western synods of the late 4th century, other than including Baruch with the Letter of Jeremiah (Baruch chapter 6) as a single book. While the majority at Trent supported this decision there were participants in the minority who disagreed with accepting any other than the protocanonical books in the canon. Among the minority, at Trent, were Cardinals Seripando and Cajetan, the latter an opponent of Luther at Augsburg.\n\n\n== In Eastern Orthodoxy ==\nThe Eastern Orthodox Churches have traditionally included all the books of the Septuagint in their Old Testaments. The Greeks use the word Anagignoskomena (\u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03b9\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1, \"readable, worthy to be read\") to describe the books of the Greek Septuagint that are not present in the Hebrew Bible. When Eastern Orthodox theologians use the term \"deuterocanonical\", it is important to note that the meaning is not identical to the Roman Catholic usage. In Eastern Orthodox Christianity, deuterocanonical means that a book is part of the corpus of the Old Testament (i.e. is read during the services) but has secondary authority. In other words, deutero (second) applies to ", "authority or witnessing power, whereas in Roman Catholicism, deutero applies to chronology (the fact that these books were confirmed later), not to authority.\nThe Eastern Orthodox canon includes the deuterocanonical books accepted by Roman Catholics plus Psalm 151, the Prayer of Manasseh, 3 Maccabees and 1 Esdras (also included in the Clementine Vulgate), while Baruch is divided from the Epistle of Jeremiah, making a total of 49 Old Testament books in contrast with the Protestant 39-book canon.\nThe Eastern Orthodox synod, the Synod of Jerusalem, held in 1672 receive as its canon the books found in the Septuagint, and in the Patristic, Byzantine, and liturgical tradition. The Synod declared the Eastern Orthodox canon as follows:\n\nspecifically, \"The Wisdom of Solomon,\" \"Judith,\" \"Tobit,\" \"The History of the Dragon\" [Bel and the Dragon], \"The History of Susanna,\" \"The Maccabees,\" and \"The Wisdom of Sirach.\" For we judge these also to be with the other genuine Books of Divine Scripture genuine parts of Scripture. For ancient custom, or rather the Catholic Church, which has delivered to us as genuine the Sacred Gospels and the other Books of Scripture, has undoubtedly delivered these also as parts of Scripture, and the denial of these is the rejection of those. And if, perhaps, it seems that not always have all of these been considered on the same level as the others, yet nevertheless these also have been counted and reckoned with the rest of Scripture, both by Synods and by many of the most ancient and eminent Theologians of the Universal Church. All of these we also judge to be Canonical Books, and confess them to be Sacred Scripture.\nOther texts printed in Eastern Orthodox Bibles are included as an appendix, which is not the same in all churches; the appendix contains 4 Maccabees in Greek-language bibles, while it contains 2 Esdras in Slavonic-language and Russian-language.\n\n\n== In Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church ==\n\nIn the Bible used by the Eritrean and Ethiopian ", "Orthodox Tewahedo Churches, those books of the Old Testament that are still counted as canonical, but which are not agreed upon by all other Churches, are often set in a separate section titled \u201cdeuterocanonical\u201d (\u12f2\u12e9\u1275\u122e\u12ab\u1296\u1292\u12ab\u120d). The Ethiopian Orthodox Deuterocanon, in addition to the standard set listed above, and with the books of Esdras and the Prayer of Manasseh, also includes some books that are still held canonical by only the Ethiopian Church, including the Book of Enoch, the Book of Jubilees, and the three books of Meqabyan (which are sometimes wrongly confused with the Books of the Maccabees).\nThe Book of Enoch is unusual as it was quoted in the New Testament. 1 Enoch 1:9 is directly and explicitly quoted in Jude 1:14-15 and may be alluded to in Galatians 5:19. It is not part of the canon of any other churches.\n\n\n== In Protestantism ==\n\n\n=== Anabaptist Churches ===\nAnabaptists use the Luther Bible, which contains the Apocrypha as intertestamental books, which has much overlap with the Catholic deuterocanonical books; Amish wedding ceremonies include \"the retelling of the marriage of Tobias and Sarah in the Apocrypha\".\nThe fathers of Anabaptism, such as Menno Simons, quoted \"them [the Apocrypha] with the same authority and nearly the same frequency as books of the Hebrew Bible\" and the texts regarding the martyrdoms under Antiochus IV in 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees are held in high esteem by the Anabaptists, who faced persecution in their history.\n\n\n=== Anglican Communion ===\nThe Thirty-nine Articles of Religion of the Church of England lists the deuterocanonical books as suitable to be read for \"example of life and instruction of manners, but yet doth not apply them to establish any doctrine\". The early lectionaries of the Anglican Church (as included in the Book of Common Prayer of 1662) included the deuterocanonical books amongst the cycle of readings, and passages from them were used regularly in services (such as the Kyrie Pantokrator and the Benedicite).\nR", "eadings from the deuterocanonical books are now included in many modern lectionaries in the Anglican Communion, based on the Revised Common Lectionary (in turn based on the post-conciliar Roman Catholic lectionary), though alternative readings from protocanonical books are also provided.\nThere is a great deal of overlap between the Apocrypha section of the original 1611 King James Bible and the Catholic deuterocanon, but the two are distinct. \nThe Apocrypha section of the original 1611 King James Bible includes, in addition to the deuterocanonical books, the following three books, which were not included in the list of the canonical books by the Council of Trent:\n\n1 Esdras (Vulgate 3 Esdras)\n2 Esdras (Vulgate 4 Esdras)\nPrayer of Manasseh\nThese books make up the Apocrypha section of the Clementine Vulgate: 3 Esdras (a.k.a. 1 Esdras); 4 Esdras (a.k.a. 2 Esdras); and the Prayer of Manasseh, where they are specifically described as \"outside of the series of the canon\". The 1609 Douai Bible includes them in an appendix, but they have not been included in English Catholic Bibles since the Challoner revision of the Douai Bible in 1750. \nUsing the word apocrypha (Greek: \"hidden away\") to describe texts, although not necessarily pejorative, implies that the writings in question should not be included in the canon of the Bible. This classification commingles them with certain non-canonical gospels and New Testament apocrypha. The Society of Biblical Literature recommends the use of the term deuterocanonical books instead of Apocrypha in academic writing.\n\n\n=== Lutheran Churches ===\nLuther termed the deuterocanonical books \"Apocrypha, that is, books which are not considered equal to the Holy Scriptures, but are useful and good to read.\" These are included in copies of the Luther Bible as intertestamental books between the Old Testament and New Testament.\n\n\n=== Methodist Churches and Moravian Churches ===\nThe first Methodist liturgical book, The Sunday Service of the Methodists", ", employs verses from the biblical apocrypha, such as in the Eucharistic liturgy.\nThe Revised Common Lectionary, in use by most mainline Protestants including Methodists and Moravians, lists readings from the biblical apocrypha in the liturgical kalendar, although alternate Old Testament scripture lessons are provided.\n\n\n=== Presbyterian Churches ===\nThe Westminster Confession of Faith, a Calvinist document that serves as a systematic summary of doctrine for the Church of Scotland and other Presbyterian Churches worldwide, recognizes only the sixty-six books of the Protestant canon as authentic scripture. Chapter 1, Article 3 of the Confession reads: \"The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration, are no part of the Canon of Scripture; and therefore are of no authority in the Church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved, or made use of, than other human writings.\"\n\n\n=== Reformed Churches ===\nThe Belgic Confession, used in Reformed churches, devotes a section (Article 6) to \"the difference between the canonical and apocryphal books\" and says of them: \"All which the Church may read and take instruction from, so far as they agree with the canonical books; but they are far from having such power and efficacy as that we may from their testimony confirm any point of faith or of the Christian religion; much less to detract from the authority of the other sacred books.\"\n\n\n== New Testament deuterocanonicals ==\n\nThe term deuterocanonical is sometimes used to describe the canonical antilegomena, those books of the New Testament which, like the deuterocanonicals of the Old Testament, were not universally accepted by the early Church. Jimmy Akin calls these books \"New Testament deuterocanonicals\". The antilegomena or \"disputed writings\" were widely read in the Early Church and include:\n\nThe Epistle to the Hebrews\nThe Epistle of James\nThe Second Epistle of Peter\nThe Second Epistle of John\nThe Third Epistle of John\nThe Epistle of Jude\nThe Book of Revelati", "on\nThe Apocalypse of Peter\nThe Acts of Paul\nThe Shepherd of Hermas\nThe Epistle of Barnabas\nThe Didache\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBiblical apocrypha\nBiblical canon\nPseudepigrapha\nAncient Canon Lists\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHarrington, Daniel J.
